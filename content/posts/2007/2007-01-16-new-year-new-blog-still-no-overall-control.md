title: new year, new blog, still no overall control...

I've been occupied with my [Study of the Political](http://www.robdyke.com/goldsmiths "Study of the Political") for most hours of the last quarter of 2006 and have had precious little time for anything other. My blogs [BEC](http://bec.robdyke.com "Brent East Campaigning") and [STMP](http://stmp.robdyke.com "Sarah Teather Is My MP") have not been updated in months... a sad state of affairs really. Furthermore [proposed boundary changes](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/2f123bcc3c5e238c80256ad20034644f/a91ffed1c469597d8025721b005bf024!OpenDocument) and my moving plans mean changes! Brent East will no longer exist so [BEC](http://bec.robdyke.com "Brent East Campaigning") will need to be revised. Sarah Teather may no longer be my MP with the obvious implications for the [STMP](http://stmp.robdyke.com "Sarah Teather Is My MP") blog....

So I'm consolidating my online presences and merging my blogs. I've imported all articles from BEC and STMP along with my personal tech/politics blog into this site: robdyke.com/noc. The NOC stands for two things: Network Operations Centre and No Overall Control. These two definitions are linked; I continue to develop and nurture networks, both socio-political and technological and I continue to be interested and engaged with London Borough of Brent politics. And as we know, there is No Overall Control of Brent Council.
