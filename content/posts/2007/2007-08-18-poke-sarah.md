title: Poke Sarah!
---
[Sarah Teather and other Brent Liberal Democrates have joined facebook](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/000385.html "Link to related Lib Dem news page"). I've poked her, have you?

I wasn't expecting to see our Sarah on Facebook... A [few years ago electronic networking wasn't on her list](http://www.robdyke.com/stmp/?p=31 "An archived blog posting") methods for constituency communications. How things change over time: the ubiquity of the term "social networking", meaning a twittering, bebobuzzing space for me to show my face on the internet, has overtaken "blogging" in terms of its penetration into the nations daily lexicon.

<p class="news">
  Sarah sees Facebook as a compliment to her existing constituency working: "It's important to be accessible to all my constituents, and there are lots of ways for people to meet me face to face."
</p>

  "Young people often have very strong opinions on local and national issues. Sites such as Facebook provide another way for me to hear their views. I can also use the site to tell young people about the work I am doing on their behalf. For lots of younger adults the internet is now the main way of keeping in touch. I hope that having a page on Facebook will encourage many more people to come forward with issues and campaigns they would like me to take up."

But Facebook is a closed community, a members only space on the internet: at least MySpace member pages are public! These "[Social websites expose class divide](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2111020,00.html "A Guardian news story of the same title")". Blogging, i.e. online publishing with comments, is open and public and seeks to engage readers in a transparent dialog.
  
As we know from recent escapades that [some people around Brent's elected representatives like to engage in online 'activism'](http://www.recessmonkey.com/2007/07/06/wiki-wars/ "A blog post exposing wiki wars between Brent MPs")... So I hope that Sarah's Facebook account and our other MPs for that matter are only being operated by her and not by their teams. As we know from the [Facebook terms of service](http://www.facebook.com/terms.php), in the User Conduct section:

  * In addition, you agree not to use the Service or the Site to:
  * register for more than one User account, register for a User account on behalf of an individual other than yourself, or register for a User account on behalf of any group or entity;
  * impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent yourself, your age or your affiliation with any person or entity;
  * impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent yourself, your age or your affiliation with any person or entity;
