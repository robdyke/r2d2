I'm interested in starting an e-journal of politics essays written by Goldsmiths students - want to help make it happen? The only requirement for publishing being that the essay received a First when marked. Publishing would be under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) [Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/). Drop me an email at my goldsmiths account (ss601rd@...) or leave comments here.
