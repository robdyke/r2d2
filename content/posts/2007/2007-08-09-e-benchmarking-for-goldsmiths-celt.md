title: E-Benchmarking for Goldsmiths CELT

---
Towards the end of term at Goldsmiths I participated in a huge number of half-baked surveys and poorly designed questionnaires. Still, that's my own fault for saying 'Yes' to all the last minute BA Sociology / Psychology students, desperate to get some data to evaluate for their assignments. The E-benchmarking survey for [CELT](http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/learning/ "Goldsmiths centre for e-learning excellence"), on the other hand, was a focused piece of qualitative research using interviews with students to benchmark e-learning activity at Goldsmiths.

I've posted the full [transcript of the interview on my wiki](http://www.robdyke.com/wikwikwah/index.php?title=Transcript_of_CELT_interview "transcript of the interview on my wiki") if you'd like to read it.

My key messages to CELT were:

  * more bandwidth on campus and in halls of residence as the disconnection of students is lamentable
  * more student participation on learn.gold so that we can originate content
  * less (hopefully no!) attachments on learn.gold - I hate downloading PDFs and word documents to read some text that could have been displayed in the web page... especially when the download is not something I am going to edit, like, say, a reading list or a course timetable.
  * working and useful interfaces to resources such as the library catalogue

I await the complete report from CELT to see what other feedback there has been and to see what recommendations have been picked up.
