title: study tools

I've invested a lot of time in researching and testing tools to support my studies. i wanted to to break away from so-called 'productivity tools', as in all my years of using software like Visio, Word, Outlook, I've never really been productive: too much of my time and effort has been wasted in taming the application, or repeated manually generating my desired formatting - perhaps counter-productivity tools would be more accurate.

I'm in my third year of studying for a BA. I'm researching my subjects and my ideas, reading lots, annotating my reading, working on assignments, editing and revising my work. I work in different locations and at different times and I want access to my work where and whenever I am. As such, a piece of hardware, a laptop or a pda is not the whole answer to these needs, I need software to support my study too.
  
 **bring on the tools.**

I'm using [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) to maintain a repository of all of my work, internet accessible with version control. Into this repository I'm saving my Freemind mindmaps when I'm making notes and working on essays. I'm using [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) for my bibliography which, with [TeXShop](http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/ "TeXShop homepage") as a word processor, gives me beautifully formatted and clearly referenced essays. Saving my bibliography and my essays as I write them into the repository gives me version control, the ability to step backward and forward in the development of my ideas.

I'm escaping proprietary formats. I'm escaping the anti-productivity trap. No longer spending time, making sure what I see is what I get... I'm concentrating on the content. So far it's working well for me. I find that I make more and clearer notes from my reading and in lectures and seminars. Research and planning for assignments has become less of a chore as I have focused more on the topic than the tool. Perhaps my good experience with e-learning tools is down to me being a hacker, or at least a very competent ICT user... It's not been easy and at times the learning curve has been long and shallow. But the investment paid off with all my assessed word-processed work receiving positive comments on my presentation and on the accuracy of my bibliography.
