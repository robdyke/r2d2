An open letter, to be emailed to each of the candidates standing in Brent East at the forthcoming general election.

Dear Candidate,

I am writing to all the candidates standing in Brent East at the general election with a question. Each party has unveiled their manifesto. National commitments have been made for the program of the next government, which ever colour it ends up being.

Assume you and your party are elected at the next election and you are able to carry out your commitments to the nation.

What do you see as the three main areas of life in Brent East which your parties policies are going to have the most immediate and lasting effect on and how will we see the results in our daily lives?

I will be sharing your responses on a weblog monitoring and reporting on the Brent East election campaign - http://becampaign.blogspot.com - and I will be also using your responses as a guide in making my own decisions come polling day.

I look forward to reading your reply.

Yours sincerely,

Rob Dyke
