There is to be [a General Election on May 6th](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/06/gordon-brown-may-6-election), along with the [local elections](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections). You would think it had been called back in December given the fluster and bumph in the media. The snow wasn't enough to distract us from the political machinations at Westmonster. That snow will probably become an election issue this year, if anyone remembers it - perhaps there will be some more before the election.

Brent East no longer exists; the boundaries were redrawn and now I'm in Brent Central. And no, I'm not renaming the site. This is Barmy Brent afterall, so why not?
