Developed by [Big New World](http://www.bignewworld.com/labour_page.htm) for the Labour Party, [Web-in-a-Box (WiaB)](https://www.labour.co.uk/About.htm) is a website-building tool for the Labour Party family. "You don't need any specialist programming knowledge to edit the site - just basic word processing skills." 

So, is it a bit like using Blogspot/MT then?

Here's an [example](http://www.nickainger.labour.co.uk/) of what it produces...So a LOT like blogspot then....

But it's NOT! It's the same old, tired, static, centralised, plug-and-produce website that stifles any sort of discussion or relationship with an MP. The 'news' feed (from the central Labour party) has nothing new since the 24th July...The lastest 'post' is regarding the Big Conversation...yawn....

Now...if WiaB was Blog-in-a-Box we'd be getting somewhere!
