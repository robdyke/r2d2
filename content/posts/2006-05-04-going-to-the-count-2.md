Last year I was the guest of Team Green. This year Team Yellow have invited me to join the best lockin in Brent. Once again I'll bring you the result and a pretty graphic from the floor of the town hall as the result is announced....assuming I don't fall asleep! I'm tired now. Not from any intensive campaigning like the Teams... I'm a 6-week-new-dad! We'll see if I make it through to the small hours again!
