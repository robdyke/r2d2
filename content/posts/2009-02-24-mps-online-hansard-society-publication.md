Just been listening to the Toady programme on R4 and heard in the news report at 8am that the Hansard Society had published a report on MPs online. According to [the Societies' website](http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/edemocracy/archive/2009/01/28/mps-online.aspx "Hansard Society Blog"), this "research attempts to understand how MPs themselves feel the internet affects the way that they work and communicate with their constituents. The research includes a survey of MPs and a focus group of MPs and their office staff."

I'd love to share more with you, but the report is not yet available online for downloading or purchasing.
