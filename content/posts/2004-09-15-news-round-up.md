Ok, I know I said that I wasn't going to comment on [that story](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/155.html), but in the end I did. I had some time while sitting waiting for my outbound flight. And yes, my holiday was very refreshing, thanks.

Teather Opens Erin Court
  
Sarah cut the ribbon (I assume; no photo of this) on Erin Court on Friday 3rd. Developed by [Sutherland Housing Association](http://www.housingcorp.gov.uk/resources/register/rsldata/sl3194.htm), Erin Court provides housing for key workers from Brent specifically education and NHS workers.

You can read more on how Brent Council are enabling education workers to live in the borough [here](http://www.brent.gov.uk/teachers.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/2d6883cc010c3d9180256d090049ddf5!OpenDocument).

And I'm a big fan of the [Pay-As-You-Drive carshare scheme](http://www.smartmoves.co.uk/) too. More of these please! Anything that works to reduce the level of cars on London's roads gets my vote!
