I'm a big user of messaging applications. From my email addiction to my instant messaging accounts. I like IM's. I like online status messages. My current online status reads: 'that's not a pig - it's a shaved cat with its tail permed'. My friend Adoms' status messages are usually a gem. Currently it reads

> 'We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.'

Well said.
