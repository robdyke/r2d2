[Custom googlemaps info posted to the wikwikwah](http://www.robdyke.com/wikwikwah/index.php/Custom_googlemaps) following 22C3. I learned a lot at a session called 'Learning Javascript with the Googlemaps API. As I don't code &#8482; this session was just what I had been looking for.

All I need to do now is ... dun dun dar!...something with it!
