title: Queen&#039;s Park Tower Plan
url: /2006/04/23/queens-park-tower-plan/
---
The proposal for the tower block in Queen's Park is a lead topic for each of the parties contesting the electoral ward of Queen's Park. For Labour it is getting like the Monty Python topic not to be mentioned in front of our hosts for the World Cup. The Lib Dems have made great gains from this thread - well, a sitting (yet not restanding) Councillor defected to Team Yellow with the tower plan as a key issue. The defection as on the front page of this weeks Willesden and Brent Times and the 'bun fight' at the Queen's Park Corral was analysed over a double page spread.

The Green's in Queen's Park have made opposing the development symbolic of their opposition to decision making without consultation - a characteristic of Brent Council in their view.

While I have not seen any campaign literature from the Conservatives in Queen's Park (please forward some if you have it!) the Party is opposing developments in the Dudden Hill area - maybe they have the same tac in QP?

More to come:

  * Lib Dem scans....
  * Labour negative campaigning against the Lib Dems in Mapesbury
  * Scans from the press
  * Links to other places....

Thank you for reading.
