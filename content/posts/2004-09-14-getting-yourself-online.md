Order a beer from the Salusbury, maybe a slice of pizza from the deli, or take a seat with an eat from Baker and Spice...

Open your laptop. Power up your PDA.

Set up your WiFi connection. The name (SSID) of the QPWC network is 'COMWIFINET' (there are a few additional characters, but you'll see it).

Open your web browser and got to a website. You'll get redirected to a splash screen showing a login. Click on guest and you'll have access!
