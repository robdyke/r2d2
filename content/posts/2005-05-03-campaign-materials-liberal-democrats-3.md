title: Campaign Materials -  Liberal Democrats

A departure from the tabloid red top of Brent News, the latest campaign freesheet from the Lib Dems, Brent News, leads with the headline of 'Sarah Set To Win' - naturally...

It features a photo of the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy with Sarah Teather on Kilburn High Road. Good to see that when top 'names' (to borrow the description Yasmin gave to the 'top labour' people who have given her support) from the Lib Dems come to support their candidate it is their Leader and prospective Prime Minister that visits.

Any sign of Tony Blair or Michael Howard in Brent East other than on advertising hoardings or standing next to George Bush on Sarah Teathers campaign materials?
