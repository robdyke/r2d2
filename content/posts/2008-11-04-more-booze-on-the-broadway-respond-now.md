The NW2 residents association is [alerting local residents to an application for a 24h license for the sale of alcohol](http://www.northwesttwo.co.uk/main/node/17) by a new business opening on the broadway. The former New Heights Furniture Shop in Cricklewood Broadway has been taken over by a supermarket called Way–2–Save. They have a branch in Neasden which has very good range of food, fresh fruit and veg and a halal butchers which would add to the choices for supermarket shopping in the area in a positive way.

I've emailed an objection to Brent Council's Health Safety & Licensing team as I agree with NW2 and other local residents that Cricklewood does not need more alcohol provision as it is already 'well stocked' by a vast array of bars and off licences.

Brent Council have responded promptly to my email:

> <font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for your representations about Mr XXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXX's</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">application for a premises licence. We have reviewed your representations and accept them as valid objections (under the Licensing Act 2003). We will now arrange a hearing to decide whether or not to grant the premises licence.</font>

Keep an eye on the NW2 website for further updates.
