I popped down to Bridge Park yesterday morning, for reasons which will become clear.... Bumped into Errol Williams, preparing for a busy day out in Brent Proclaiming Christ's Lordship. His first pledge is to bring all legislation is brought into conformity with the word of God. I uploaded his materials to TheStraightChoice for reference and they are included in the slideshow.

Bridge Park is just of Brentfield as you come down from Harlesden.
