"A letter of complaint against Sarah Teather was sent to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, supposedly from a  man at an address in Brent. Then a second letter of complaint was sent, again from this man, but giving a new address. However, this new address does not exist. There is a real address with the same house number and postcode (but different rest of address), at which there is one person on the electoral register – a woman who has the name of someone listed on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s register of interests as being a member of her staff." [Yes, very odd](http://www.libdemvoice.org/sarah-teather-dawn-butler-18615.html "libdenvoice").
  
These claims were also being [hawked in letters sent to Mapesbury residents by Labour candidate Angela Griggs](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/?p=162 "Brent East Campaigning").
