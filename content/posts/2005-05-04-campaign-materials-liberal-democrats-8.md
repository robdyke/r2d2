Received a letter from Charles Kennedy this morning urging me to vote because 'in certain places, the election is effectively a straight choice between having a Liberal Democrat or a Labour MP'.

The real alternative has been distilled to four key points:

  * end student tuition and top-up fees
  * prevent older people having to selltheir homes to pay for long term personal care
  * provide 10,000 more police and cut their paperwork
  * scrap the unfair council tax

A little something for everyone.
