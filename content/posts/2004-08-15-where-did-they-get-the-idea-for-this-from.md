The [House to Home](http://www.housetohomelive.com/) exhibition organised by the [Hansard Society](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/) at Westminster Hall yeilded some interesting - although hardly suprising given voter turnout figures - feedback from its 45,000 visitors. More than 80% of respondents felt excluded by Westminster politics.

I had a poke around the online version of the exhibition.

From the site you can [create your own banner](http://www.housetohomelive.com/4-your-opinion.html) and send it someone as an e-card.

Here's one from me.

And here my memory started to stir... Havn't I seen this [sign-generator](http://www.ryano.net/iraq/) [idea](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1115829/posts) [before](http://www.snopes.com/photos/military/boudreaux.asp)? Well, it's been taken down now...but I bet you one chocolate biscuit that's where the idea came from!
