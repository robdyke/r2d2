From wikipedia: [Stonebridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonebridge,_London) is the largest electoral ward in Brent and includes Stonebridge Estate, and parts of Park Royal and Brent Park, St. Raphael's Estate, Mitchellbrook and the Hillside district. The area has strong links with the Afro-Caribbean community which forms the ward's ethnic majority.

Here are a few photos of the last remaining block on the Stonebridge Estate off Hillside, Brent. You can see the cleared land from recent demolition work in the foreground.

Here you can see the newly built Fawood Childrens Centre in the foreground.

And yes, [Brent Labour can use these photos in campaign materials](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/2010/05/04/does-dawn-know-or-care-where-stonebridge-is) as they are public domain.
