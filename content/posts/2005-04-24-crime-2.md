The candidates from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are all highlighting crime in their campaigns.

  * But do we need 'more police on patrol to make our area safer for all'? (Sarah Teather - Standing Up For You)</p> 
      * Has the fear of crime 'increased' in Brent? (Kwasi Kwarteng - In Touch) 
          * Is 'crime and the fear of crime and issue for every neighbourhood in London'? (Yasmin Qureshi - Mapesbury Labour News) </ul> 
            If you'd like to see the crime statistics for Brent, the Met have great [interactive map](http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/#), but data looks better as [text only](http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/boroughs/QK_month.htm).
            
            But do the stats tell the whole story? You'd kind of expect 'incident count' crime statistics to increase; I'm not saying that crime is impossible to reduce, just that there could be externalities to the data: a population increase in a borough for example. I'm looking for a crime rate per capita index and other data sets, and if I find any I'll share them. We can find stastics for just about anything but I'm having trouble finding a dataset on 'fear of crime'...
