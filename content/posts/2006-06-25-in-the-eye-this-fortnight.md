"- [IT upgraded in **Brent** â€“ so council staff can discuss the world cup online](http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=rotten_boroughs&#38; "Private Eye")" - maybe the Council and BRAVA will find the resources to support [The Bonnet Project](http://www.bonnet.me.uk/ "Bonnet Project") so residents associations and community groups can communicate with each other online.
