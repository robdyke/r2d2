title: Hackdays - Levelling the Playing Field
---
In my job at Tactix4 I worked with others in the opensource and healthcare space to produce this briefing note for Cabinet Office on the use of hackdays to achieve a level playing field for Open Source in procurement and production.

This short note was produced in response to a request from Liam Maxwell made at EHI Live 2012 to investigate how hackdays could help procurement.
