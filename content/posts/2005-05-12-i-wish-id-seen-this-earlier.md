Trawling through the list of refering links to this site I came across a search engine, A9.com, that I hadn't heard of. I followed the link to discover where this blog was ranked on the list that refered the reader to the blog. Just below the link to this blog was a link to [Film Makers Against War](http://www.filmmakersagainstwar.org).

I wish I'd seen the film made of the [Brent East Stop The War Hustings](http://becampaign.blogspot.com/2005/04/hustings-tonight.html) earlier.

Here's a [link to the movie](http://www.filmmakersagainstwar.org/movies/cymp_brent.wmv). I've [mirrored it here](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/cymp_brent.wmv) to save their bandwidth.

More on this to come after I've had my European Politics Exam.
  
Prizes to whoever watches the film and then posts here with the best guess to the comment I've going to make.
