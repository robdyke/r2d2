While technically in [Brent North](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/2f123bcc3c5e238c80256ad20034644f/140245e5895cc69480256c07005c1943!OpenDocument) the elections for local councillors for the Preston and Fryent wards of Brent still need reporting - and where better then here?

[Brent Councils Local Democracy](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/2f123bcc3c5e238c80256ad20034644f/266d6bb2498b188a80256ffe003b5b4c!OpenDocument) pages have lots of information on the elections which will take place on the 16th June 2005.

Shahrar Ali will be standing in the Preston Ward as the Green Party Candidate. The Greens didn't have a candidate in Brent North at the last election so it will be interesting to see how Shahrar and the Greens do in Preston - a gague of Green support in Brent North if you will. The [ward has had Conservative councillors](http://www.brent.gov.uk/Democracy.nsf/031d5c68638196618025664000760871/6343c37649c12f7580256ace003c4eb8?OpenDocument&#38;Start=1&#38;Count=60&#38;Expand=13) in the past... Let's see if we can get some Green on [this map](http://www.brent.gov.uk/Democracy.nsf/4e7fdabfd21a870080256a94004088ab/6be0bf25c2a6e42680256baf00348bc2!OpenDocument).
