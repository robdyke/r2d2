Yesterday moves were made to begin [impeachment proceedings](http://news.google.co.uk/news?hl=en&ned=uk&q=impeach+blair&ie=UTF-8&filter=0&scoring=d) on [Tony Blair](http://www.impeachblair.org/). I want to know where Sarah stands on this issue.

Dear Sarah Teather,

Yesterday afternoon a group of MPs launched a campaign to impeach Tony Blair for "high crimes and misdemeanours" in the run up to the war against Iraq.

As I'm sure you will agree, the prime minister still has a case to answer regarding his role in persuading parliament to support the war in Iraq. Despite two public inquiries related to the intelligence on which the case for war was made, there remain serious unanswered questions involving Mr. Blair’s involvement in making that case, which was based on a false premise: that Iraq’s WMDs posed a threat to Britain. These questions were deliberatly put beyond the remits of both the Hutton and Butler reports.

In the report, Glen Rangwala and Dan Plesch give numerous examples of statements made by the prime minister which, by omission, exaggeration and semantic trickery, they believe painted a misleading picture of the intelligence available to him at the time.

Where do you stand on this issue? Will you be supporting moves taken to impeach Tony Blair? I urge you to vote to try Tony Blair before parliament so that this matter can finally be resolved and the country’s confidence in the government of parliament restored.

Yours,

Rob Dyke
