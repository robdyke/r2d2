title: Sarah Teather no longer my MP?
---
As many of you know I used to have a blog here called ['Sarah Teather is My MP'](http://robdyke.com/tags/sarah-teather/). But it looks like soon (2015) Sarah is to stand down from Parliament and will no longer be my MP. The former Children's Minister [told the Observer](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/07/sarah-teather) that she feels Nick Clegg's party no longer campaigns sufficiently for social justice and liberal values on immigration. In a [statement on her website](http://brentlibdems.org.uk/en/article/2013/719362/sarah-teather-statement-on-decision-not-to-stand-for-parliament-in-the-next-general-election), she said that her differences with the party "have been getting larger rather than smaller".
