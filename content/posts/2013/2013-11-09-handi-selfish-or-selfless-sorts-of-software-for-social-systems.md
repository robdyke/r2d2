Presented to the [HANDI Health Apps conference at EHILive 2013](http://www.ehilive.co.uk/page.cfm/action=seminar/libID=1/libEntryID=77/listID=20) and continuing my series of provocative and disruptive anti-presentations here I talk about approaches to developing, distributing and deploying software solutions in social systems. If you think this is an extended rant on the virtues of opensource, think again. Drawing on Mauss, Dawkins, Benkler, Chesbrough and others here I discuss how NHS organisations and software developers and vendors can each have cake and eat it. There was no reading list set for this presentation, however homework was given.
