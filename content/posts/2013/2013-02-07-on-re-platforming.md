title: on re-platforming....
---
This week I went to a supplier engagement event led by people from the Government Digital Services on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board. Under discussion was the re-platforming of a major component of services provided to patients.

Hopefully the re-platforming will be as easy as replacing the engine in an aeroplane mid-flight.

And doesn't end up crashing....

And that the development direction taken is lightweight, agile and cheap!
