New figures from the [Electoral Reform Society](http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/index.php) examine exactly how well each party would have done under two systems of PR: Alternative Vote (AV) and Single Transferable Vote (STV).

While they show that under AV the Lib Dems would only increase their seats to 79, the most interesting think for me is that the Conservatives still poll the most seats but insufficient for a majority in all examples.

A Lib/Lab coalition under AV would have a 60 seat majority, with a Lib/Con group a majority of 98. Under FPTP a Lib/Con coalition has a notional 106 majority over Labour. A Lib/Lab group manages just 8 seats. Under STV, a Lib/Lab coalition would have a 123 seat majority, with a Lib/Con group a majority of 201.
