from the website of the [Kilburn Times](http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/content/camden/kilburntimes/news/story.aspx?brand=KLBTOnline&#38;category=news&#38;tBrand=northlondon24&#38;tCategory=newsklbt&#38;itemid=WeED05%20Apr%202006%2016%3A45%3A36%3A537) (as this saves me scanning the paper):

"The two highly-paid bosses of the £1bn South Kilburn regeneration project have been suspended while the council investigates allegations of misconduct exposed by the Times

South Kilburn New Deals for Communities chief executive Jack Davis and his deputy Bill Husband, both reported to earn upwards of £80,000 a year, are responsible for regenerating one of the most deprived housing estates in Britain.

Our investigative journalism revealed that they were using a council flat on the estate as a rent-free pied-a-terre."
