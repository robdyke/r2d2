receiving this letter was one of the prompts to get me back blogging again - an evening with Charles Clarke. The Home Secretary was to visit Brent East to meet and greet and have a Big Conversation with people about the Respect Agenda, law and order (as someone with some political education I shouldn't right law and order as I know that the concepts are fused when they should be kept seperate) and crime and policing.

I'm pleased Charles had the time to make it over to Brent East. That I was invited I wanted to share with others.
