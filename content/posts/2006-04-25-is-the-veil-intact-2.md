Electoral law prevents a council from promoting candidates standing in local elections. Has the spirit of the 'purdah' period been broken by Brent Council? The [Brent Lib Dems seem to think so](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/302.html). Now, I've not yet seen the article in question, my copy of the Brent Magazine has been sitting unread since it arrived and usually only gets a slight glance before being recycled. I'll get a scan and post it. But until then you'll just have to talk Lib Dem Council Leader Paul Lorbers' word for it - the Labour council have spent public money on a publication that features a candidate standing in the local election. So the BELD are asking for the Labour party to reimburse the costs of the publication.
