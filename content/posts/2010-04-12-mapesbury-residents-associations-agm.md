The Mapesbury Residents Association are holding the groups' Annual General Meeting on the 19th April. After the formal meeting there will be an Election Hustings. All the political parties have been invited and it will give you the opportunity to meet the candidates for election - councillors as well as MPs.

The MapRA AGM is a lively and informative event. With the usual high-quality nibbles,Â  there are also stalls and information stands from the police, Brent Council and other local groups and organisations.

  * Part 1, MapRA stalls, 7pm
  * Part 2, MapRA formal meeting, 8pm
  * Part 3, Election Hustings, 8:30pm

I look forward to seeing you there.
