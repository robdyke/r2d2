...or had you'd missed that?

I want to share the Brent East campaign experience from the point of view of the electorate. And I want to distribute information about the candidates and the parties standing in Brent East to my neighbours in this constituency. So until the 6th of May, when the hangover is gone and the lost sleep caught up on, I'll put most of my posting efforts into ['Brent East Campaigning'](http://becampaign.blogspot.com/)

I've got a few updates to post - mainly scans of recent communication from Sarah.

Had a bit of a reorganise of the links and the news feeds on the site - you now get an RSS feed of news items from Sarah's website as well as her activity in Parliament.
