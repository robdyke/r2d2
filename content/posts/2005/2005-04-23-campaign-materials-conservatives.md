When I met Kwasi on Thursday at the MapRA AGM I mentioned to him that I hadn't seen any campaign materials from him over the last couple of weeks. Yesterday an Election Communiation from Brent East Conservatives was delivered by Royal Mail.

> His message: 'The Conservatives are the alternative. I promise to give you, the electorate, my boss, more for your money. This isn't some form of magic. Our policies are based on common sense. We will allow all people to get on with their lives and contribute to the constituency in their own distinctive way. We will not allow our diverse and vibrant communities to be shackled by bureaucracy or political correctness.'
