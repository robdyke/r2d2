Some of you may remember that I [wrote to Sarah](http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com/2004/08/will-sarah-vote-to-impeach-blair.html) asking her if she will be supporting the motion to [impeach Tony Blair](http://www.impeachblair.org/). [She wasn't minded to.](http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com/2004/09/update-impeaching-tony-blair.html)

She wrote to me last week after going through some papers and finding my email. Papers? Email? I know, I didn't quite get it either. I digress. She wrote to me last week to bring an Early Day Motion she had recently signed to my attention.

> "I have decided to support a <a>Private Members' Bill</a> currently going through parliament which says that parliamentary approval should be given through a vote in the House of Commons before a Government decides to send troops into conflict. At present such decisions are made by the Government alone, using the outdated Royal Prerogative. There is a parliamentary motion that I have recently signed regarding this, along with twenty-three of my Liberal Democrat parliamentary colleagues."
