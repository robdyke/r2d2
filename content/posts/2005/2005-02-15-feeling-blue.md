I wasn't sure who the campaign material that recently popped through my front door belonged to. I wasn't inclined to turn the flyer over really... I read the Guardian & the Indy, I get enough conservative bashing on a daily basis to have toned it out. But who was it from... Labour or Lib Dem? A closer inspection and I trained my eye on the graphic in the bottom corner which gave it away as anti-tory material published by Brent Lib Dems.

Nice idea... printing the banner in blue to try and outwit the Brent East Conservative Voter into picking it up from their doormat and reading it.

The flip side of the flyer featured former Conservative voters who have switched to Liberal Democrat. [You can see it here.](http://www.comwifinet.com/sarah_teather_mp/st_blue_jan_mailer_s2.jpg)

What does Sarah feel she has to gain by marketing herself as 'not conservative, yet supported by conservatives' in Brent East?
