title: What are the policies of the three main parties?
---
Found quite a useful page on the [Politics](http://www.politics.co.uk/) website this morning. They have [grouped the policies of each of the three main parties on specific areas together for your comparison](http://www.politics.co.uk/codestructurepage.aspx?code=430014488&menuindex=430014385). Nifty.

It beats downloading and reading each of the manifesto documents. But if you really wanted to, here you go

* Liberal Democrats, [PDF file](http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/manifesto2005.pdf), 20 pages, 1.1mb
* Labour, [PDF file](http://a4.g.akamai.net/7/4/15010/1/labourparty1.download.akamai.com/15010/manifesto_13042005_a3/pdf/manifesto.pdf), 56 pages, 916kb 
* Conservatives, [PDF file](http://www.conservatives.com/pdf/manifesto-uk-2005.pdf), 32 pages, 712kb 
* Greens, [PDF file](http://manifesto.greenparty.org.uk/site/downloads/file1290GreenPartyManifesto2005.pdf), 32 pages, 376.6kb
