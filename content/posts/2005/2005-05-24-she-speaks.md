Well, those where her [first words of the new parliament](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2005-05-23.523.1)...

Sarah returns to the House of Commons and continues her efforts at tackling the housing 'crisis' in Brent. Those of you who are regular readers of the BELD website will recall her [speech of Oct last year](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/articles/20.html) in Westminster Hall on this topic.

Unfortunately the [debate was adjourned](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-05-23.420.2#g523.1) shortly after Sarah had joined the debate. More on the [TWFY.com](http://www.theyworkforyou.com) feed tomorrow!
