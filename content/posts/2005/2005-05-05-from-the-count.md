title: From the count....

Well, I didn't expect that I'd be at the count for the Brent constituencies General Election ballot. But strange things happen in blogsphere...

I'm joined by NK a friend from Goldsmiths. We're surounded by more rosets than a horse show. It is a three legged...sorry...horse race (sorry Kwasi) after all!

Some of the ballot boxes have arrived already but the count isn't fully underway.

Results as and when I get them!
