I was speaking to Shahrar Ali last night about the Green campaign in Brent East and Brent South.

Something about a solar powered public address system playing a campaign song being cycled by tandem around the constituency. Anyone got any snaps?

I hope to be able to post an MP3 of the song here soon.

After speaking with Costas who owns the Olive Tree organic food store on Willesden Lane I'm becoming more convinced of the Green proposition. For Costas, if you put aside party politik and vote from your heart, the only vote is a Green vote. A Green landslide in Brent East? You only have to look around and you'll see thousands of trees waving in support.
