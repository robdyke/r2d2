title: Sarah Teather Is STILL My MP
---
I've woken up and eaten - needed to do that before posting anything. NK and I left the count after Sarah Teather had been returned as the MP for Brent East, but not before posting to [sarah teather is my MP](http://stmp.robdyke.com/). I've still got the 'wild eyes' I had yesterday, although that's now from lack of sleep. This politics junkie had quite an Election Day.

As I posted yesterday, I'd been [out and about in Mapesbury and Willesden](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/2005/05/06/sarah-teather-is-still-my-mp/) with June Thomas from Slate Magazine. You can hear a dispatch from June made before the election on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4627315). After giving June a [whistle-stop tour of Willesden](http://www.slate.com/id/2117174), I had an afternoon of revision to do before going to the count in the evening.

And what a night. I want to thank Shahrar Ali and Rowan Langley from the Green Party for inviting me to join their party at count. That was probably one of the best 'lock ins' I've ever been too. It was a night of tension and drama with the Brent East result called last after stacking and restacking of bundles of ballots. And at the end of it all Sarah Teather is STILL my MP.
