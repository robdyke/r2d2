Public Servants.

[mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) have launched [WriteToThem.com](http://writetothem.com/), the successor to the multi-award-winning FaxYourMP.com. WriteToThem lets people write to any of their elected representatives: MPs, MSPs, MEPs, Welsh or London assembly members, and last (but certainly not least) their local councillors.

Thanks to [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/14/fax_your_mp/) for the link up.
