What else is there to notice about Brent East News 'Delivering for YOU'...

I read the whole of the Ken Livingstone interview on the [London Labour Party website](http://www.london.labour.co.uk/ViewPage.cfm?Page=15286). Campaigning in Brent East with Yasmin Qureshi Ken said:"I am delighted that my first election visit is in my old seat of Brent East, where human rights campaigner Yasmin Qureshi is in pole position to become Britain's first ever Asian woman."

The 'round robin' makes four mentions of Yasmin's ethnicity and gender. Today the [Independent](http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=633345) reports on [analysis by the Fawcett Society](http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Pub_Briefing.htm) of the proportion of women selected as candidates by the political parties. Looks like there is going to be an appeal to traditionally political inactive minorities in the final days of the campaign. Is this a competition between the Lib Dems and Labour? But pointing out gender and ethnicity and campaigning on it is a bit crass, no? I mean, I've got eyes...
