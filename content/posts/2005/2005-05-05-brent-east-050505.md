My first stop was Sarah Teather HQ at 1 High Road to give my support before going off to meet Sarah at her polling station.

Team:Yasmin are at Willesden Green tube, handing out leaflets that look like an inducement to shop at a furniture store (to be scanned later) before going off to vote.

I met with June Thomas - Hi June! - Foreign Editor for Slate magazine at Willesden Green. We walked and talked Brent East and the local campaign.

Spotted a vandalised Labour Party poster...
