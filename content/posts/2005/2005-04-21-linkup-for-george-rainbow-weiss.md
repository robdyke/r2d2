Thanks to a reader, here are some links for the Vote For Yourself Dream Ticket Party and George 'Rainbox' Weiss.

This [website](http://www.hydatum.com/) details the background to the V4YDTP.

While [this page](http://www.hydatum.com/page16.html) has DTP info.

Links from a reader [collecting campaign leaflets from this election](http://leaflets2005.blogspot.com/). Send them some of the paper the Brent East Candidates send you.

The Guardian website also lists George 'Rainbow' Weiss, but not as a candidate in this election (they need to get that page of their site updated). They list some additional info for George, including a link to [www.xat.org - The Peaceful Revolution Network.](http://www.xat.org)
