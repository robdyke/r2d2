Received a letter from Charles Kennedy this morning urging me to vote because 'in certain places, the election is effectively a straight choice between having a Liberal Democrat or a Labour MP'.

The real alternative has been distilled to four key points:

* end student tuition and top-up fees
* prevent older people having to selltheir homes to pay for long term personal care 
* provide 10,000 more police and cut their paperwork 
* scrap the unfair council tax

A little something for everyone.
