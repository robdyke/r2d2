After yesterdays mammouth posting session I went out for a while. I hadn't had chance to even leave the building before my mind was drawn back to this blog. More campaign materials from Sarah Teather, local Liberal Democrat. This one an official 'Election Communication' delivered by Royal Mail.

'Standing Up For You' highlights Sarah's work during her term as MP for Brent East on local 'quality of life' issues and links the Lib Dem policies to local 'real people' through a varity of in-action photos.

I've not had chance to scan all of it. Here is the [front](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/st-standingup4u-front.jpg) and the [back](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/st-standingup4u-back.jpg) for now.
