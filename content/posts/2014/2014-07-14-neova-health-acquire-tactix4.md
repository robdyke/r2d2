  So: Neova Health recently acquired Tactix4, my company which had built up a strong and somewhat high profile track record in developing products and providing services for open technology solutions in social and health care. Neova Health recognised that Tactix4 were widely acknowledged as critical and crucial exponents of openness. Both myself and Eckhard - co-Director of Tactix4 - recognised that Neova Health shared our values. It was a match made in open source heaven.

  Neova Health are passionate about strengthening relationships between people, patients, practitioners and providers of services in health and social care settings. The acquisition of Tactix4 is the first of many value-driven investments in business with innovative offerings in this sector.

  I'm really excited by this change. Growing Tactix4 has been great fun. Growing Neova Health will be even more so.
