Really? 6 months since my last update? Bonkers.

By way of an update, here are a few slideshares from recent conferences I've been presenting at.

At Healthcare Innovation Expo Tactix4 were participants in the NHS England Open Source Programme and I shared these slides as part of my discussion

Back in Manchester a week later for BCS Health 2014 I participated in the stream 'Fit for practice – exploring the nursing experience of the usability of clinical systems' facilitated by the Royal College of Nurses and Chaired by Dr Susan Hamer of The National Institute for Health Research. Here I discussed the implementation of a clinical system and how the success of this project was rooted in the nursing-led implementation.
