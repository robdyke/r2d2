> Good morning Mr Yeo,
> 
> You're probably going to be reading a few of these messages today, so I thank you in advance for reading mine.
> 
> Can I just say that, for what it's worth, I don't think Mr Tim Ireland has been a very helpful chap with regards to the e-government agenda he has been pushing. Photoshopping you was rude to say the least.
> 
> But he, and the rest of us, do have a valid point. Blogging is the cheapest, most direct, discussion mechanism politians can engage in. And while effectiviness has yet to be proven due to its infancy, this movement does have big potential.
>
> Here's what I would do.
>
> Throw caution to the wind, accept the transfer of tim-yeo-mp.blogspot.com to your administrative control and then blog away! Taste and see that the online world is good.
> 
> Thanks for reading this.
>
> My next task is to email Sarah Teather, my MP for whom I blog at http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com, and see if she will get blogging.

> Regards,
