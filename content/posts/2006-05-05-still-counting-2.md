a few wards have been called and a few are being recounted. in several wards the gap between candidates are in the tens of votes. Brondesbury went to Team Yellow and Mapesbury and Queen's Park wards look like there will be changes there. and theÂ bar did close on time!

You can get the details on the wards here on the Brent Council website - but right now the website isn't updating....
