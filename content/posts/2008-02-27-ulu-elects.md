I'm beginning to suffer election fatigue what with GCSU, America, shortly London and ULU as well. Well damm representative governance, that's what I say.

ULU do get several points awarded for a sensible and secure electronic voting mechanism. You [can vote from this page](http://www.ulu.co.uk/elections/election/ "ULU voter login page"), **online and confidentialy,** assuming that you have got a username and password that have been emailed to your ULU College Email account.

How did they do such a thing you may ask... "Some colleges in the UoL will provide ULU with a database of the students who are eligible to vote in the elections from that college. This database includes the first name, last name, student ID number and college email address of these students." So now you know... Here is all the info on the ULU [voting procedures](http://www.ulu.co.uk/elections/content/index.php?page=20560) for the elections and [here are the candidates](http://www.ulu.co.uk/elections/content/index.php?page=21034) for your consideration.
