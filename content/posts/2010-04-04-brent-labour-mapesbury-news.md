The theme of this newsletter is rubbish. Brent Labour argue that the charge made by the council for bulky refuse collection has lead to an increase in fly-tipping in Brent and pledge to 'dump' the Â£25 charge if elected. If that isn't inducement enough for you, they claim that cuts, CUTS!, will reduce the frequency of rubbish collection.

The main flytipping problem in Brent is caused by unscrupulous builder, dumping domestic building waste. This wasn't collected by Brent for free and was always the householders/contractors responsibility. Dumping the charge for collection won't have any impact on this. Locally, co-ordinated swoops by MET police and Brent Council officers has been effective in stopping and seizing vehicles carrying waste without licenses. The local hot spots in Mapesbury that I know of haven't been hit in months.

Vote to drop the charge. But know that the cost to the council of providing household item collection will still be passed on to us rate payers.
