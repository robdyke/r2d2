Is "Happy voting!" really the proper way to close an email announcing a Council By-election? Anyway...
  
A seat has become vacant in the Stonebridge Ward following the death of Councillor Dorman Long. A by-election will be held on Thursday, 13 September 2007 to elect a new representative.

The by-election gives the Lib Dems another opportunity to win a seat - but will they win it? I doubt it. Stonebridge ward is a Labour heartland - you only have to [look at the votes cast in the 2006 Local Election](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/031d5c68638196618025664000760871/e9175a18d2181c5a8025714500529c07!OpenDocument&#038;Start=1&#038;Count=60&#038;Expand=16 "Brent Council 2006 Local Election Results") to see that... Winning this single seat will not change the overall political balance of Brent Council: The Lib Dems would need to win a few more by-elections or benefit from defections (not for the first time in Brent's recent political history) in order to be in a position to leave the alliance with the Conservatives and lead a majority administration. This by-election is a litmus paper - are Stonebridge residents pleased with [Cllr Paul Lorber](http://www.brent.gov.uk/leader "Brent Council's webpage for the Leader of the Council")'s coalition administration, enough to give the Lib Dem's another Councillor? Or will we see a new face in the Council from the Labour Party?
