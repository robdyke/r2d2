I picked up a copy of Brent East News published by Yasmin and the BE Labour Party when in Queen's Park on Monday. Under the headline 'Delivering for You' there is a photo of three police officers with a caption 'Brent now has more than fifty extra police officers'.

Fifty extra police officers! Shame that three of the fifty extra police officers in Brent East are on walkabout in Shepherds Bush. The photo of the three police officers clearly shows the [Walkabout pub in Shepherds Bush](http://www.sff.net/people/chris.amies/publist/reviews/walkabout_shepherdsbushgreen_w12.htm) in the background.
