The website of my neighbourhood's residents association, North West Two, is now up and running. Do drop by and visit them at [www.northwesttwo.co.uk](http://www.northwesttwo.co.uk "NW2 RA Website")

Take a moment to register and then you can post comments on the news and information posted to the site. There will also be two mailing lists for the community, one distributing information from the association and a second one of local freecycle, skill swap and other announcements.
