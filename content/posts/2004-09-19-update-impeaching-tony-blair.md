Last month, I [faxed Sarah](http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com/2004/08/will-sarah-vote-to-impeach-blair.html) to get her views on the move to [impeach Tony Blair](http://www.impeachblair.org/).

Awaiting me on my return from holiday was a soft creamy envelope from the House of Commons. It's dated 7th September so, if you allow for fax being sent on FRI 27th and the Bank Holiday Monday that followed, I make that a response within 5 working days. Tick in box - [Faxyourmp.com](http://www.faxyourmp.com/) informed.

In short, Sarah does not support the campaign to impeach him. She's not alone in her party either, with only one Lib Dem MP, [Jenny Tonge](http://www.jennytonge.org.uk/), having publically pledged support - although Jenny has not decided to stand as a candidate for the Lib Dems at the next election.

Sarah feels that the issue is too seminal to be resolved through gesture politics.
