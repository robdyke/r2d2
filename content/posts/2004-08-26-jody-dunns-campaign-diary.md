Today I extend my congratualtions and a big welcome to the blogging community to Jody Dunn, Liberal Democrate candidate in the (maybe) Hartlepool by-election.

You can read her blog at <http://www.jodydunn.org.uk/>

Sarah visited Jody in Hartlepool last week. [It was the highlight of Jody's day.](http://www.jodydunn.org.uk/archives/2004/08/sarah_teather_v.html)

I hope that Jody will share her blogging experiences with Sarah when they next meet. Maybe that will change Sarah's perception of blogging.
