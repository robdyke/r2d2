I checked out how sarah has voted on some recent key issues. She [voted against](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/howtheyvoted/0,,-6690,00.html) the Higher Education Funding Bill and the Lords Amendment on Foundation Hospitals.

She also voted for votes for 16-year-olds, [inline with her view](http://www.sarahteather.libdems.org.uk/article.php?id=14) that they should have sufferage extended to them.

Her views on post office closures are confirmed by her voting record and by her [questioning](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/wrans.php?id=uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2003-10-20.444W.2) of [other](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/wrans.php?id=uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2004-01-27.301W.0) MP's.
