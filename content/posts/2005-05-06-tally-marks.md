I'm reminded of the Banksy piece in Barcelona Zoo. Tally mark after tally mark after tally mark. From what I'm seeing as I tally out the ballots as they come out of the box for the collate before the count, it really is neck and neck.

For every one vote the Greens receive, the Conservatives are getting seven, the Liberal Democrats 45 and Labour 47 = 100 votes.

Thats my personal tally count taken from a few different wards and averaged.

Close. Real Close. But the Greens could still take it!
