Sarah and the BELD team must be on holiday. It took a while for the 'message from Sarah Teather MP' to appear on [Sarah's](http://www.sarahteather.org.uk/) [websites](http://brentlibdems.org.uk/)...No proclamation from the count, no pictures...

But some Excel wizard has had the time to create a new 'can't win here' graphic for the website. I never liked the old one... The margin was not large enough.
