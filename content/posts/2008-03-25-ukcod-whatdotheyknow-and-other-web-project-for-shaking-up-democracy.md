I've just been emailed about](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/) Campaign. Please go and add your weight to the call for Parliament to publish these documents which are a crucial part of the process of making law in a way that is sensitive to the electronic use over the internet.

David 'web' Cameron has already endorsed the campaign. But I'm not about to give his site linkage, so you'll have to find the video via [The All Seeing Eye](http://www.google.co.uk/).

I've also just found the beta test version of [whatdotheyknow.com](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) which aims to provide a public searchable repository of Freedom of Information Act requests made to public bodies. GREAT IDEA! Now the information made public in FoI requests is made public in a much wider sense. The site is open and searchable. The site helps people to make Freedom Of Information Act requests of public bodies, reminds you when the request is timing out (not that it will of course, our public bodies are quick of the mark with these sort of things!) and make all the information in the request public.

Praise is due.

For some feature enhancements I'd recommend adding something that will take any attachments and process them so they are readable. These public bodies, especially councils, have a habit of replying to electronic messages in the fashion of material messages. It amuses me greatly to see a properly formatted letter, typed out in a word processor... attached to an email with a message saying 'please read the attachment'. bonkers. So if [whatdotheyknow.com](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) could process attachments and display them in the webpage as well as giving us the files to download, that would be great!
