I collect pictures of crashed operating systems, dumped rubbish and digital information boards displaying incorrect information. The dumped rubbish photos are tagged with a location and uploaded to FixMyStreet for Brent Council (usually, for it is they) to resolve. Here are a couple of photos of information boards taken at St. Pancreas International (Domestic) station only last week.

Here was the London weather outlook as photographed on 8th July.... rain with a low of minus 3.

How about this timely sports news ([from this game](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jan/23/preston-chelsea-fa-cup-live))

No mention of the world cup... or wimbledon.... (results shown [from this game](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jan/24/stoke-city-arsenal-fa-cup))

I'm surprised on two counts.

  1. That I was able to take photos in public place without being questioned by security services 
      * That the information displayed is 6 MONTHS out of date </ol> 
        I'm just not sure which I am more surprised about!
