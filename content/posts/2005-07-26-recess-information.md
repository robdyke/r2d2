[parliament.uk](http://www.parliament.uk) says "The House of Commons and the House of Lords will be on Summer recess between 22 July and 9 October. The Houses of Parliament will return on the 10 October 2005."

Good thing. I'll be on recess working on [community](http://www.comwifinet.com) [wireless](http://www.queenspark.me.uk) projects for the summer months. I'll also be visiting [WTH05](http://www.whatthehack.org) for meetings with hackers, social engineers and activists.

I'll be blogging again come the political party conference silly season.

In the meantime, if anybody is interested in coming to a [democracy dinner](http://www.powerinquiry.org/) in Brent East then get in touch... I'll try and have a special guest join us ![;-)](http://www.robdyke.com/stmp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)
