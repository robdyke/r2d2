They said they'd be back soon.... They are almost as bad as me!

Low output here over the last eight weeks. I've been rather busy, spending my time studying for a BA Politics, Economics and Public policy... My studies have had greater importance than my indulgent ramblings here. Besides... she's your MP too - [email me](mailto://blogger@robdyke.com) to become a contributor to this blog.

But a few things have happend, not least the [promotion of our Sarah](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4046021.stm) to [Liberal Democrat spokesman for London](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/171.html). She takes over the role from taking over the role from new LibDem party president Simon Hughes.

Let's see how much bloggage I manage this term.
