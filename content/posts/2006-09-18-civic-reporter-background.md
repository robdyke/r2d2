The background to all this. Comwifinet had prototyped the Civic Reporter framework which is inspired by other innovative mobile technology projects, such as that implemented by Lewisham and the mySociety 'Broken Civic Infrastructure' idea. These similar initiatives all start from the question 'Would putting pictures of abandoned cars on a map on the internet help people to think again about their role in maintaining a tidy Borough?

The difference between what we were doing and these other projects is the public daily status and performance reporting of the Councils' responsiveness to reported problems in the Borough. This would have been a steep change from the current performance reporting for departments. Publishing the information online, on a map makes the scale and distribution of the tasks facing the council public. And just maybe this would help us Brent residents learn that the Council and its contractors are doing a through and quality job for us... but only for what has been reported.
