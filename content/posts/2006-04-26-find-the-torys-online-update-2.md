After bumping into one of the Dudden Hill Tory candidates last friday I now have the [correct website for the Brent Conservatives](http://www.brentconservatives.org.uk). The link has been added to the sidebar. I'll keep the old link up as it is the link that the official [Conservative Party website links to](http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=people.constituency.page&#38;obj_id=1453&#38;post_code=NW2%204RS) - when they update, so will I.

An update to [this post](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/?p=93).
