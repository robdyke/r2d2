what do I think? I think the Green's have won it really. I expect them to gain two seats, well, at least one in Queen's Park. Also, I think that Cameron may have spoken to a lot of people at a local level and Team Blue will make a few gains. Team Yellow (Look for the Bird!) will also make gains, probably bringing them level with the Blues... These gains will be to someones loss: Team Read.

The result is, I hope, consensus driven local politics. And it looks a little like this....
