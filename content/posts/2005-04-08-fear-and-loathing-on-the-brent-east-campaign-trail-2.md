I've started to blog the [Brent East constituency election campaign](http://becampaign.blogspot.com/). I'll be sharing all the paper propaganda distributed by candidates over the coming four weeks. Wide open for all the see. Informed choice facilitated.

I've met two of the candidates already, well three, as I've met Sarah Teather too. More to share on that score soon.
