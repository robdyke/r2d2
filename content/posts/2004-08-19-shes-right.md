it is ["bureaucratic nonsense"](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1286084,00.html).

Under rules introduced by the Home Office last month, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, South Africans and Americans must prove they have a good grasp of English to become UK citizens. Yet the Home Office has to decide who will judge this.

Meanwhile, applications for naturalisation are being rejected. Sarah wrote to David Blunket highlighting the "bureaucratic nonsense" of the rules after one of her constituents was rejected. The 30 year old Australian born author rejected by the Home Office has two degrees in English. Perhaps that just isn't enough.
