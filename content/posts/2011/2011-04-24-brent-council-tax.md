Brent Council [recently signed a deal](http://www.capita.co.uk/media/Pages/LondonBoroughofBrentsigns%C2%A315millioncontractwithCapitatoadministerrevenuesservice.aspx) with Crapita Business Services for council tax and business rates administration and IT support systems. [Reported](http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2011/apr/05/brent-capita-revenue-collection-contract?&#038;) to be worth £15m over 5 years, the function of the contract is to increase the council tax collection rate, with Crapita giving a guaranteed a collection rate for council tax and an anticipated £4.6 million in savings for the Council over the initial term of the contract.

The Council [General Purposes Committee recently set](http://democracy.brent.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=153&#038;MId=1385&#038;Ver=4) the 2011/12 collection rate for council tax at 97.5%, as it has been since 2001/02. As you can see, in recent years there is still a considerable way to go to reach 97.5% and apart from 2009/10 the collection is still considerably short of the 97.5%
  
target.

Let's hope the arrangement with Crapita can squeeze out the extra 2% that Brent Council can't quite manage. I wonder what the collection rate guarantee for council tax is... and if its 97.5% or greater...
