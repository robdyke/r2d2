With Brent Council is proposing to "change the way residents experience libraries in the borough" let's remember that libraries are [More Than Books](http://www.morethanbooks.co.uk/).

Friends of the libraries under threat of closure by Brent &#038; Friend of Libraries NOT under threat are campaigning to change the Councils plans. Keep up with the campaign and volunteer your support, ideas, skills and stories at [More Than Books](http://www.morethanbooks.co.uk/).
