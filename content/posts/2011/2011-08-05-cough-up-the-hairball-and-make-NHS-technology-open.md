title: Cough up the hairball and make NHS technology open
---
Here is a piece co-authored by me published in the [Guardian Healthcare Network on open source in the NHS](http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2011/aug/11/hairball-nhs-technology-open).

In my view the NHS would benefit greatly from greater use of open source, standards and data, according to the creators of the award-winning Open Me project:

> "The NHS technology environment could be described as a giant hairball â€“ a Gordian knot of past policies, established practices, new initiatives and government objectives and an ever changing landscape of opportunity from new technology. Openness, in all its many forms, offers a way to escape from the hairball."
