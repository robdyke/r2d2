Are mine eyes deceiving me?

Go to the home page of [Labour Party in Sheperds Bush](http://homepages.poptel.org.uk/lp.org.ruskin/index.html). It may be a crap URL - but it is the one linked to from the [London Labour](http://www.london.labour.co.uk) site

"If you are interested in our neighbours in Hounslow, Ann Keen or Alan Keen have
  
a look at [www.hounslowlabour.org](http://www.hounslowlabour.org)"

Click the link.....(it should be SFW but it's NSFW)

I had to mail [Tim](http://www.bloggerheads.com/). I wasn't sure..did I have dodgy DNS settings?

Apparently not.

(Not that this is easy to do. With so many of them hiding their content behind frames, a simple Googling of the URL is unlikely to detect every link. Can I perhaps suggest you take a peek at your old referral logs?)"
