So, this years [Healthcare IT Champion of the Year](http://www.ehi.co.uk/insight/analysis/1180/rounds-of-applause), the special category of the awards that is chosen by the readers of EHI, was announced as Kemi Adenubi, the GPSoC programme director for the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

Adenubi described winning the award as "absolutely fabulous"; "It was wonderful to be nominated, it was great fun to have people say ‘I voted for you’,This will be really good for the project and the team as it shows there’s some recognition for the project we have done together, because it’s an individual nomination, but I have a great team." she said.

My hearty congratulations to Kemi. Hope I didn't [disrupt your procurement](http://www.opengpsoc.com/) too much.
