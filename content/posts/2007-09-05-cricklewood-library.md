I have heard rumors locally about the closure of Cricklewood library and <span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT719" class="Object">today</span> signed a petition, organised by Friends of Cricklewood Library to keep it open.

I've emailed Brent Council and the Lib Dem Councillors to try and discover more truth or otherwise about this rumor.
