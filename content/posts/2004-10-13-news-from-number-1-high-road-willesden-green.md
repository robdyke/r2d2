In last weeks Willesden & Brent Chronicle, Sarah wrote of the recent silly season for the UK's political parties, hammered home the message that the Lib Dems are now the second party of British Politics (although, not yet Her Majesty's Official Opposition) and invited us to make a cup of tea while waiting for the pre-manifesto to download.

But this year, what struck me was how upbeat and confident the party remains, especially in contrast to the rather sour mood of the Labour conference. It has been a tremendous year for us as a Party and there is a new optimism amongst activists -my colleague Parmjit Singh Gill won in the Leicester South by-election and we came from third to push Labour to the wire in both the Hartlepool and Birmingham Hodge Hill by-elections.
