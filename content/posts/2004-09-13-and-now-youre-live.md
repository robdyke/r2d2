The Queen's Park Wireless Club (QPWC - to not tire my fingers) went LIVE this weekend, lanuching the community wireless broadband network at Queen's Park Day.

And what a day! A great response from people at the event. We're now working to follow-up with all those that we spoke to, to provide answers to FAQ's on the [website](http://www.queenspark.me.uk) and to increase the coverage of the network to provide access to more people.

Photos to follow - Coverage Map in process of being mapped - Emails to all those that left their details being written.
