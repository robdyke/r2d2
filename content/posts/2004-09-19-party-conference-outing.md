"Sex, gaffes and silly stunts - it's party (conference) time again and [Westminster's circus is heading off to the coast](http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=563085)."

Participating in the Guardian fringe debate at the Lib Dem conference on Mon 20th will be Sarah Teather. "Liberty v equality: which do the Liberal Democrats want?"
  
Simon Hoggart chairs a panel of Sir Menzies Campbell, Nick Clegg, Sarah Teather MP and Mark Oaten MP.
