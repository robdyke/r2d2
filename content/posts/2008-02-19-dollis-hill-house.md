I spend a lot of time in Gladstone Park and I've recently taken an interest in the state of Dollis Hill House. I think that the kindest word to describe the building is 'wreak'. There are plans (there are _always_ plans) to restore the house from the [Dollis Hill House Trust](http://www.dollishillhouse.org.uk/news.php) in partnership with [Training For Life](http://home.siteforlife.org.uk/tflhome/home.cfm?ccs=482&#038;cs=884). I'm not sure what they are in detail... but the appear to involve getting a whole bunch of money together to renovate the building into a venue of some kind - better than flats... no worse than demolition.

I'm interested to know more details about the project, how it will be a 'social enterprise', how it will fund its self &#038;tc... more to come, I'm sure...
