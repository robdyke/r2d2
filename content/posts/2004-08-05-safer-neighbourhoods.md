[On Monday](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/146.html), Sarah attended the launch of the [Metropolitian Police Safer Neighbourhoods](http://www.met.police.uk/saferneighbourhoods/faq.htm) initiative in Kilburn.

First launched for the [Stonebridge Estate in April](http://www.brent.gov.uk/www.nsf/0/3f6d8fbbc267968c80256e6e00539678?OpenDocument) this year, the program aims to provide new teams of uniformed officers working within communities to tackle quality-of-life issues and anti-social behaviour crimes.

Sarah commented that it was community policing that local people wanted. "Not only do they want more police on the streets, they want police officers who they know and trust. I look forward to the day when the 'Safer Neighbourhoods' scheme is rolled out across Brent" she said.
