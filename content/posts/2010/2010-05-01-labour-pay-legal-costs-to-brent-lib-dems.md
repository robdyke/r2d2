Brent councillor James Powney [laments the threat and use of legal writ to silence debate](http://jamespowney.blogspot.com/2010/04/sarah-teathers-legal-threat.html), tending towards an environment where 'legitimate freedom of speech could be restricted by self censorship.'

Legal writ has its strength though. When Brent Labour distributed a [leaflet with false claims](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/2285/) about Sarah Teather, the Brent Leb Dems took appropriate legal measures. In the face of the legal action, Labour have now admitted their story was false and [agreed to pay the Lib Dems legal costs](http://www.libdemvoice.org/brent-sarah-teather-dawn-butler-15187.html).

Dawn Butler, Ann John and other Brent Labour members have all signed a [written apology](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/2010/04/21/butler-issues-full-apology-for-teather-expenses-smear/) to Sarah Teather.

Sarah Teather does not need to make up claims about Dawn Butler and her expenses. [Dawn Butler's Â£66,000 expenses claims are a matter of public record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/dawn_butler/brent_south#expenses).
