The Straight Choice election leaflet project is an archive of election leaflets distributed throughout the campaign. This is a helpful thing to be doing as .....

1) Promises that candidates make in their leaflets can be compared to what they promise to do elsewhere. In the future we can also compare the voting record of MPs with what they promised on the campaign trail.

2) It helps catch parties or candidates who are breaking electoral law - 2 parties have been reported to the authorities based on leaflets uploaded to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thestraightchoice.org/">TheStraightChoice.org</a> in the past couple of weeks.

and

3) We get to see how the corporate identity of the main parties messages are tightly managed nationally.
