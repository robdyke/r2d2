The Willesden and Brent Times spoke to local candidates standing as independents or for the smaller parties, including [Shahrar Ali for the Green Party](http://www.shahrarali.net/ "Shahrar Ali website") and Atiq Malik.

Atiq Malik is Brents' [own 'controversial' candidate](http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2009/02/atiq-malik-british-politician-calls-for-stoning-adulterous). An ex-conservative councillor in Queensbury ward,  jumped/pushed from the party in 2008, he has previously been referred to the [Standards Board for England](http://www.standardsforengland.gov.uk), the standards watchdog for Councillors and other officials. He was subsequently cleared of misconduct. Atiq Malik's pledges have a clean up politics air about them, the usual puff against employing family members, claiming second home allowances (like Brent's Dawn Butler and her £66,000 of expenses), having jobs outside parliament... He could do with starting the political clean up in his own office by all accounts. Illegally copying private correspondence and distributing it for political aims is not the sort of politiking I want see represented in parliament.

I've scanned the pages or you can also get the [WBTimes article](http://tinyurl.com/37l6pjf "WBTimes") online.
