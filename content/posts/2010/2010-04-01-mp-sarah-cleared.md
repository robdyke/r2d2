"A letter of complaint against Sarah Teather was sent to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, supposedly from a  man at an address in Brent. Then a second letter of complaint was sent, again from this man, but giving a new address. However, this new address does not exist. There is a real address with the same house number and postcode (but different rest of address), at which there is one person on the electoral register – a woman who has the name of someone listed on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s register of interests as being a member of her staff." [Yes, very odd](http://www.libdemvoice.org/sarah-teather-dawn-butler-18615.html "libdemvoice").
  
These claims were also being [hawked in letters sent to Mapesbury residents by Labour candidate Angela Griggs](/2010/03/25/mapesbury-labour-team-smear-tactics/).

From [WB Times](http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/content/camden/kilburntimes/news/story.aspx?brand=KLBTOnline&category=news&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newsklbt&itemid=WeED30%20Mar%202010%2017%3A07%3A59%3A630) today. Sarah Teather smeared by member of Dawn Butlers team in fictitious expenses complaint.

AN INVESTIGATION into the expenses of one of the borough's MPs has been abandoned after it was found that a letter of complaint was fictitious.

The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said an objection claiming that Brent East MP Lib Dem Sarah Teather sublet her constituency office in Willesden to her party while the taxpayer picked up the bill was not genuine.

A follow up letter from the complainant included a returning address that was almost identical to that of an employee of Labour MP for Brent South, Dawn Butler, who is also Minister for Young Citizens and Youth Engagement.

The commissioner also said he discontinued the inquiry because he had no grounds for believing that claims Ms Teather made from parliamentary funds for her office provided support to the cost of the Lib Dem party.


As the complaint was made, Ms Teather, who was famed for not claiming a penny during the expenses scandal, strenuously denied the allegations.

Brent Liberal Democrats said the party contributed over and above its usage of the office, as approved by the Commons, calculated by a surveyor and agreed with a solicitor.


"Dawn Butler must take immediate action and reveal the full facts if any person employed by her has been involved in this smear campaign against Sarah.
