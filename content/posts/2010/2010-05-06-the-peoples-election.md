Mr Brown was [asked for his reaction to the news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8661593.stm) that celebrity TV supremo Simon Cowell was backing the Conservatives and thought the prime ministers was tired. ﻿﻿"[This election isn't about celebrities, it's about people](http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2010/05/gordon-its-not-about-celebrities.html)", he said. Yet we have had a lot of [celebrity involvement](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/2010/05/05/kilburn-station-645pm/) in the national and local campaigns:

Labour celebrities: Ross Kemp, [Jo Brand, Eddie Izzard](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5362), [David Tennant](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5365).

Conservative celebrities: Michael Caine, erm..... (help me out here, I don't watch the telly!)

Lib Dems: Floella Benjamin, erm.....
