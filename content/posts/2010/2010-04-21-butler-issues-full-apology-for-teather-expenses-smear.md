[LibDem Voice](http://www.libdemvoice.org/dawn-butler-sarah-teather-apology-19014.html "libdemvoice") has some news on Brent Centrals dirty politics.

Labour Minister Dawn Butler has issued a legal apology to Sarah Teather for calling her a hypocrite over MPs’ expenses. Butler made the accusation while the running of Sarah Teather’s office was under investigation. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner later [dropped the investigation](http://www.libdemvoice.org/sarah-teather-dawn-butler-18615.html) because there were no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by Ms Teather.

This issue came up at the MapRA Hustings on Monday night. There was a question from the floor on expenses which had Dawn attempting to justify [£66,000 ACL since 2005 for her Wembley second home](http://www.wbtimes.co.uk/content/brent/willesdenchronicle/news/story.aspx?brand=WBCOnline&category=news&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newswbc&itemid=WeED06%20May%202009%2013%3A06%3A20%3A883 "WBTimes"), when she has another property in Stratford. As we know, Sarah Teather has not claimed the second home / additional costs allowances. Dawn did well and may have carried it, but a follow up question on Brent Labours' smear campaign and the [ficititous complaints](http://www.wbtimes.co.uk/content/brent/willesdenchronicle/news/story.aspx?brand=WBCOnline&category=news&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newswbc&itemid=WeED30%20Mar%202010%2016%3A03%3A49%3A563 "WBTimes") to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner about Sarah Teather by someone from Dawn Butlers team made a stench. Sarah announced that she had received a written apology from Dawn - you can [download it](http://anmblog.typepad.com/files/labour-party-apology.pdf) - and won the 'clean up dirty expenses' applause.

Cllr Ann John attempted a last minute clawback... however her proclaiming of a 'citizens right to know' sounded hollow, now that we know of the 'false... improper...wholly untrue....' nature of what they wanted us to know.
