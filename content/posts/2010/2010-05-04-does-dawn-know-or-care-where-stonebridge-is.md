title: Does Dawn know (or care) where Stonebridge is?
---
On this mornings [electoral communication from the Labour Party](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/4980), Dawn Butler highlights housing, in particular the investment in Stonebridge and St. Raphael's Estate where monstrous concrete high rises are being destroyed, replaced with low-density and low-rise housing.

Only that is not Stonebridge. It's Trellick Tower, 3miles down the road in Ladbroke Grove.....

The stock photo comes from [PhotoEverywhere](http://www.photoeverywhere.co.uk/britain/london/slides/trellick_tower_concreteP1039506_jpg_orig.htm).

This isn't the first time Labour have had stock photography issues locally. Remember the [50 extra police on Brent's streets](/2005/04/27/fifty-extra-police-officers-in-brent/) in Yasmin Qureshi's materials in 2005 that were photographed in Shepherds Bush?
