Liberal Democrat candidate [Ed Fordham needs just 474 votes](http://hampsteadandkilburn.org.uk/) to win the seat from [Glenda Jackson](http://www.glenda-jackson.co.uk/). Driving through QP this afternoon I saw lots of Labour posters and flags with only a few Lib Dem orange diamonds. Looks like there is mroe work for the Lib Dem team to do there. The Torys had just a single board - just like the solitary piece of literature I found from them today. Poor [Chris Philp](http://www.chrisphilp.com/).

I've just scanned and uploaded all the materials I could gather in [Queen's Park ward of Hampstead and Kilburn](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/constituencies/hampstead_and_kilburn/) to TheStraightChoice.
