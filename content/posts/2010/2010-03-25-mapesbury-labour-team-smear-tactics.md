In a recent letter to residents of the Mapesbury ward of Brent Central, Labours' candidate Angela Griggs slings a little mud on expenses. Apparently complains have been made to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner about Sarah Teathers' expenses in relation to her constituency office.

Now we know Sarah's expenses are squeaky clean - [check TWFY.com](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/sarah_teather/brent_east#expenses "TWFY") and compare the ACL to [Dawn Butler and her Â£66,000](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/dawn_butler/brent_south#expenses "TWFY")....
