Busy outside Kilburn Station this evening. Picked up a whole host of goodies and the Evening Standard.

Team Glenda gave me a DVD with ROSS KEMP on it! 'Gone in 60 seconds' explains "[what's at stake on Thursday](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5369)". Hopefully. He. Makes. It. Easy. For. Me. To. Understand.

Some more celebrity messages for Team Labour attacking the Tories from [Jo Brand and Eddie Izzard](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5362). And David Tennant shares with us that he thinks David Cameron is "[a terrifying prospect](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5365)" in a viewspaper '[Britian's recovery at risk from Tories](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5364)'.

I also read David Cameron's Contract With [me]. [Headline: If we don't deliver, kick us out. Detail: In five years time.](http://www.thestraightchoice.org/leaflets/5366)
