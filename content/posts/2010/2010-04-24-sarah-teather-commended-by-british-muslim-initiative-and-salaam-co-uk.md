[**YouElect**](http://youelect.org.uk) is a non-profit and independent British Muslim grassroots initiative aimed at promoting voter registration and political engagement. I've just looked up [Brent Central](http://youelect.org.uk/constituency/brent-central "Profile of Brent Central") where [Sarah Teather is the Community Choice Candidate](http://youelect.org.uk/constituency/brent-central/ppc/sarah-teather), commended by both the [British Muslim Initiative](http://http://www.bminitiative.net/) andÂ  [salaam.co.uk](http://salaam.co.uk/).

[Dawn Butler](http://youelect.org.uk/constituency/brent-central/ppc/dawn-butler) and [Sachin Rajput](http://youelect.org.uk/constituency/brent-central/ppc/sachin-rajput) are also profiled on the YouElect site.
