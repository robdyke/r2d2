The deadline for nominations closed at midday on 8 April 2010 and [details of the candidates for the local elections](http://www.robdyke.com/electreg.nsf/Files/LBBA-11/$FILE/SOPN.pdf "Local elections 2010 Statement of Persons nominated")Â are available in this PDF, published on 9 April. A PDF? Have Brent Council learned nothing about publishing information online? I'll rework the list and make it nice and human-readable without having to download a PDF!
