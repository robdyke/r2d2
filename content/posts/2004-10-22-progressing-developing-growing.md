The QPWC is live.

We are currently working on the final few elements of the club formation and then all you prospective members can start signing up.

The equipment used to connect home desktop PC's will be arriving with Comwifinet early next week, along with the hardware for more network nodes to increase coverage and quality of service in area.

Also, a colaborative self-assistance forum will go live early next week. Based on the principles of information sharing and community self-sufficiency the forum will enable members to help themselves and help each other with any issues that may encounter. It is hoped that this support form will become a valuable technical resource for all computing matters, not just those relating to the wireless network.

cut the cord.
