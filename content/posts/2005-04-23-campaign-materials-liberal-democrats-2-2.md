I've received a letter from Sarah Teather for her campaign to be re-elected by the people of Brent East to serve a second term.

> Her message: 'I believe that people in Brent East deserve a local MP who will stand up to Tony Blair. I am proud to fight this election on my record of local action from fighting for fairer funding for our local schools to welcoming more police for Dudden Hill, Kilburn and Willesden Green.'

Here's the [full letter](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/st_letter.jpg) as a JPG.
