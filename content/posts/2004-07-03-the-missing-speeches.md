OK. After some further searching I found the speeches. Firstly, the reason I couldn't find the searches is that they were not made on the 1st of July as the news posts on the Brent & Brent East Lib Dem web site states and secondly, the speeches were made in adjournment debates in Westminster Hall, not in the House of Commons as the photographs would suggest.

So, updated with correct, relevent and contextual information, here is the Brent & Brent East Liberal Democrats 'Content In Brief' for 2nd July 2004.
