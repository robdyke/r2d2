Just digging around the Hansard Society website for a copy of the report on MPs online, published by the e-democracy unit and I found the blurb for this event, [The Online Campaign](http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/upcoming_events/archive/2009/01/29/the-online-campaign-solution-or-smokescreen.aspx), in late March.

> The use of online strategies is becoming increasingly important, encouraging grass-roots activism and enabling mass mobilisation. But there is no guarantee that the cooption of online strategies will guarantee electoral success or promote healthy dialogue between politicians and citizens.
> 
> **Chair:** Dr Laura Miller (Hansard Society eDemocracy programme)
  
> **Speakers:** Derek Draper (<span class="new">LabourList</span>.org), Mark Pack (libdemvoice.org), Jonathan Isaby (ConservativeHome.blogs.com)
> 
> Tuesday 24 March, 10am, House of Commons, Westminster.

I wonder if the new [Director of Digital Engagement](http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk/index.asp?txtNavID=113&txtOverRideDocID=48837 "Job Post at Civil Service Careers") will be in post by then and if that person will attend this event.
