I've been investigating the feasibility of collecting and publishing final year dissertation projects in book form. I think that this will make a great reminder of our time of study, our political alliances and the friendships that have grown over the years at Goldsmiths. Also it's such an indulgent, gratuitous act: So Fucking Goldsmiths. My plan is to gather together our dissertations and publish a book (ISBN record and everything) of our works to have it printed and ready for graduation in September.

[Print On Demand / Short Run printing](http://www.openmute.org/pod/?PAGE=podservices "openmute") is readily accessible and affordable. A run of 100 works out at a per book cost of around a tenner. The result is a quality product too. There are POD books currently on sale in the college bookshop (look for [Media Mutandis](http://publication.nodel.org/ "node.l website") in Media/Culture) that you can take a look at to see what the finished result would look like.

I hope that I can drum up enough interest to make the project viable as solo-publishing my dissertation would be lonely!
