According to [Publictechnology.net](http://www.publictechnology.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=17334 "LibDems using open-source software"), the Liberal Democrats have decided to go for Open Source software for organisational infrastructure. The LDs have selected an [open-source consultancy and technical services business in Rugby, Credativ,](http://www.credativ.co.uk/about/news/archiv/2008/liberal-democrats-decide-to-go-for-open-source-software.html "Credativ news article") to migrate and support crucial parts of the LibDems tech needs.

I'm very pleased to see this commitment to free and open-source software by a major political party!
