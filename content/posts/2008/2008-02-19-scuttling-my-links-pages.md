title: scuttling my links pages....
---
Goodbye to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/robd "my del.icio.us links") and [simpy](http://www.simpy.com/user/robdyke "my simpy links"): I don't get anything out of these social bookmarking services so I'm leaving them. The reason I joined was to share my bookmarks quickly and simply with others, in the case of del.icio.us, with a view to collaborating with others on creating a resource, in the case of simpy and the smithspolitics group.

Yet as I still have a need for quick bookmarking and the global access a website provides me I've adopted a clone of the social bookmarking model, [scuttle](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/ "Scuttle on sourceforge"), and installed it [here on robdyke.com](http://robdyke.com/pages/ "My scuttled links").
