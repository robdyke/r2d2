I've just finished a paper on social, peer-to-peer, participatory financial models. In the paper I contrast traditional banks and interest bearing capital transactions to these emergent models. I've been looking at three different examples of these new business models, Zopa, Kiva and Open Capital, considering to what extent these organisations are challenging established practices.

The [full paper is available as a PDF](/pubfiles/2008/04/majoressay.pdf). As soon as I've got my LaTeX/HTML conversion working I'll post that too.
