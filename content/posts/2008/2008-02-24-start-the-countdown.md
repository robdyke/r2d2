News that [Ralph Nader has announced plans to run again for the US presidency](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7261670.stm "BBC News item") got me googling like crazy this afternoon...

Just to share with you the ["Beastie Boy Ad Rock’s remix of Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader](http://gnn.tv/videos/4/Countdown "GNN website")’s blistering critique of the news media and the current state of American politics." Posted to the Guerrilla News Network (GNN).

Turn it up.
