"The story of the BBC Micro is one of British innovation; it's about how one machine inspired a generation of youngsters to use computers," said [Dr Blyth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7303288.stm "BBC News website").

The BBC Micro was host to my first computing experiences. According to the BBC, the Science Museum plans an exhibition about the BBC Micro and its legacy in 2009 - I'll be there.
