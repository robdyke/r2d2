Plenty of keyboard time coming up over the next few weeks...

The dissertation project continues: are radical openness of f/los communities embodying resistance to Empire? My proposal was graded at 8/10 ... must be doing something right. Now to maintain that effort!

Also researching a paper on social. p2p and participatory financial models with specific reference to banking systems. [Zopa,](http://uk.zopa.com/ZopaWeb/) [Kiva](http://kiva.org/) and [Open Capital](http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8&#038;sourceid=navclient&#038;gfns=1&#038;q=open+capital+chris+cook) are my case studies. Meeting with the CFO of Zopa tomorrow!

Reading: Empire, Multitude, several commentaries on Hardt &#038; Negri, plenty of politics and post-structuralism. Phew!
