It's been a busy fortnight for open-information projects and campaigns. Widely [announced](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/nov/06/free-our-data-government "Guardian news story") and [re-announced](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ipm/2008/11/show_us_a_better_way_winner_an.shtml "BBC PM story, blog post") were the [winners](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/11/and-the-winners-are.html "SUABW winners, blog post") of the [Show Us A Better Way](http://www.showusabetterway.com/ "What would you build with public information?") (SUABW) competition, sponsored by the Government, which sought new solutions to perhaps unknown problems. SUABW asked people what web-based tools they would build from public data-sources that wouldÂ  improve the way public information is shared and presented.

The winners are:

  * [Can I Recycle It?](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/can-i-recycle-i.html)
  * [UK Cycling](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/uk-cycling.html)
  * [Catchment Areas](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/catchment-areas.html)
  * [Location of Postboxes](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/07/location-of-pos.html)
  * [Loofinder](http://www.showusabetterway.co.uk/call/2008/09/loofinder.html)

The BBC PM report referred to a court case being thrown out because a piece of law that the case was built on had been taken off the statute book. The codified law of the British Isles is a huge chunk of public data I'd like to see freed up, so I'm hoping for great things from the [Free Our Bills](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/ "Free Our Bills") campaign: wide open and accessible Parliamentary Bills... searchable and remixable legislation... a wiki statue book?

Sarah Teather wrote back to me this week concerning EDM2141, saying

> The Liberal Democrats believe that Bills ought to be published in such a fashion that they can be accessed as easily and as early as possible by the public.

Sarah will be adding her signature to the EDM which currently has 76 members of Parliament supporting it.
