I received the Green Party Election Communication for Brent East earlier this week. I've scanned the 100% RECYCLED PAPER leaflet for you to download from here ([front cover](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/gp_sa_fc_web.jpg), [inside](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/gp_sa_inside_web.jpg), [back cover](http://www.comwifinet.com/becampaign/gp_sa_back_web.jpg)).

If you have not received the Green Party Election Communication, please [let me know](mailto://brent_east@robdyke.com) and I will pass it on to Shahrar. I spoke to him yesterday and apparently there has been a problem with the delivery of the leaflets by Royal Mail.
