(even if the content could do with some more work...)

I've not used TeX for several months... getting to grips with it again today has reminded me of the value of practice in developing a skill. Thankfully I still had all my outline templates from earlier in the year so I had a skeleton to work from.

I am using a basic article template with Helvetica font. My references use the Harvard family of bibliographic styles. After much testing I've settling on the Kluwer bibstyle and the DCU citation style.

Here is an [example of how my essays look](http://www.robdyke.com/wikwikwah/images/8/87/Essay_template_for_smiths.pdf) now. Over on my wiki I've [posted my template file](http://www.robdyke.com/wikwikwah/index.php/Using_TeX) for others to use.
