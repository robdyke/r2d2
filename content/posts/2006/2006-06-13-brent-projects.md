I posted recently on what could be done next with this journal. ["wither b.e.c?" i asked.](http://www.robdyke.com/bec/wp-trackback.php?p=124 "A b.e.c. post from the past") well, new projects are on the horizon. I've been working on a community information network project with Colin George, [Chair of QPARA](http://www.qpara.org "Queen's Park Residents Association") and Director of MarketSpark (publisher of the excellent [Local Directories](http://www.local-directory.net/ "Local Directories") for Brent residents associations). We see a need to weave links between associations and organisations active in Brent and an opportunity to develop such a network in the light of the demise of Brent Community Empowerment Network.

MarketSpark and Comwifinet are working together to augment and extend community network links through a varitety of mediums. [The Bonnet Project](http://www.bonnet.me.uk "The Bonnet Project") is the working title of our efforts.

Because the Brent Community Empowerment Network is no longer with us, [BrAVA](http://www.brava.org.uk/ "BrAVA") have a large stack of cash to put towards a community consultantion project or give back to Brent Council. Perhaps BrAVA will see it to support the Bonnet Project? Who knows...
