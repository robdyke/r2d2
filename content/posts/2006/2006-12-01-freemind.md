previously at the [gold.socialtools.org](http://gold.socialtools.net/) web project...this year I've been posting my lecture notes on my wiki at [robdyke.com/goldsmiths](http://www.robdyke.com/goldsmiths/). I've been using Freemind to make my notes in lectures. From the wiki the source of my notes can be downloaded and editted. Wikka Wiki includes the java viewer so the mind maps can be viewed with a web browser.
