I wanted to post this when I got home from the count early this morning but the brent.gov webserver had broken and was not serving the Election Pages. 404errr. That and they were still counting when I got home. And recounting no doubt. You can get the [full results for all the candidates in each ward direct from brent.gov.uk](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/2f123bcc3c5e238c80256ad20034644f/fe1a92465d95e48f80257164003457d9!OpenDocument) as they are uploaded.
