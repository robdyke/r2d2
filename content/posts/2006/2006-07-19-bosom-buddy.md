This story got me posting as I'm a new father and my daughter is breastfed. Sarah was [campaigning earlier this week](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/healthmain.html?in_article_id=396288&#38;in_page_id=1774) with the NCT in support of their call for legislation to enshrine a woman's right to breastfeed in public in England. The Scots have such legislation (must have been a devolved competancy) but in England and Wales breastfeeding in public is not protected. Both myself and my partner are in support of this legisation and support the [NCT's](http://www.nct.org.uk/) campaign.

You can find out [more about the campaign for this legisation](http://www.nct.org.uk/media/pressrelease?prid=63) at the NCT website. The campaign was launched during Breastfeeding Awareness Week.

Only bad thing about this post is that I have linked to the Daily Mail website.
