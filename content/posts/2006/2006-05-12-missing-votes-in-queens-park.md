title: Missing votes in Queen's Park ward?
---
Did those of you who stood up to be counted on May 4th get counted?

I've spent today researching the process for the counting of ballots and gathering information on the election result in Brent as I believe that there is cause for concern over the result returned in Queen's Park ward. My concern centres on the counting of ballot papers with unallocated votes. let me explain...

You each had three votes on your ballot paper. Some of you voted for three candidates from the same party (a block vote), some of you for candidates from two or more parties (a split vote). Some people voted for two candidates: in Queen's Park there were two Green Party candidates, voting only for them would have been a block Green vote but would have left one vote unallocated. If you voted for Rocky Fernandez only, you would have not allocated two of your votes.

In Queen's Park, [3642 voters turned out](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/031d5c68638196618025664000760871/e9175a18d2181c5a8025714500529c07!OpenDocument&#038;Start=1&#038;Count=60&#038;Expand=14) giving a total of 10,929 potential votes. The results show 9,320 votes were cast, leaving 1,606 unallocated votes. Interesting...if these votes had been cast would Queen's Park still be Yellow? The gap between Neil Nerva (1,059) and Michael Motley (1,102) is only 43 votes...I want to know more about these 1,606 unallocated votes. Does that number seem high to you? Shahrar Ali, Green Party candidate in Queen's Park has been analysing the results as 1,606 unallocated votes appears "inexplicably large" to him.

> The discrepancy is inexplicable on three grounds: (1) in comparison to adjacent wards, Kensal Green (387) and Kilburn (827); (2) in comparison to Queens Park in 2002 (513 on 25% turnout); and (3), more fatally, an approximation of the ratio of unspent votes to used votes that must have shown on ballot papers in the "mixed" pile (where cross-party voting took place) for the overall count TO BE TRUE. Unfortunately, that ratio is CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS OBSERVED. Therefore, the VALIDITY of the count is put into SERIOUS QUESTION.

Here's his analysis of the numbers: [Queen's Park unallocated votes](/pubfiles/2006/05/qp_unspent_13_may.pdf){#p128}. Is it possible that a bundle of split / mixed ballots were not counted?
