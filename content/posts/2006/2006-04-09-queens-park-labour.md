ever wanted to know who your queen's park labour action team are? me too. I picked up this flyer in queen's park ward in early march. The snap shows Cllrs Neil Nerva, Helga Gladbaum and Reg Freeson campaigning for safer stations and more police in
  
queen's park.

I wonder if their campaigning will be rewarded in on May 4th? Do people feel their stations are unsafe? Does queen's park need more police? Are these the issues people put at the top of their agenda of local action points?
