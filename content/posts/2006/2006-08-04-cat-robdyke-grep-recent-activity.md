Civic reporter has received an initial 'thanks but no thanks' from Brent Council. I'm going to post their analysis of the application and my reponse here. this morning I was at home with the baby. I love being at home in the day, it gives me the chance to stand and watch my neighbourhood go by. I counted five Brent Council branded vehicles go past my house, collecting my green box, then my green bin and later my household wheelie bin. A fourth pickup collected some dumped household furniture and the fifth was street sweeping. I know Brent Council take our street care and waste management seriously: let's see how seriously they take transparency and participation in service delivery.
