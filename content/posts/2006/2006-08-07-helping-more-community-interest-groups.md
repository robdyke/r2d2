I'm hoping that this coming week will see two local residents associations get online with powerful internet based self-publishing tools provided by comwifinet. These two groups, one in Stonebridge and one in Mapesbury, will also become part of the Bonnet network of community interest groups, extending the Bonnet network and improving their own effectivness as a result. I'll be posting links to their websites and to their Bonnet information pages as soon as they are active.
