[Brent Labour Councillor Jonathan Davies has joined the Liberal Democrats](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/) reports the BELD website.

"I have realised that the beliefs I stand for such as the safeguarding of our civil liberties, international justice and a free and fair society are best represented within the Liberal Democrats."

Also connected to Jonathan's feelings over the [proposed development of a tower block in Queen's Park](http://stopthetower.co.uk) ? : "The issue of Queen's Park Tower is a classic example of Brent Labour in action. Consultation with local communities is kept to a bare minimum with decisions being made by a small cabal of Labour politicians and unelected Brent Council officers."
