Are you serious?

Each day I walk from Mapesbury to Queen's Park via Brondesbury/Kilburn wards - sounds like a round about route but I'm just walking cross the boundry corners. In contrast to the General Election last year there are not many posters out on display in gardens and in the shop windows in support of ANY political party up for election in May. However I have noticed that of the posters that are on display the Green's and the Liberal Democrats have strong support.

Queen's Park is going green. That is green as in Green not as in blue>green. Here's hoping that the Green's can sit in some of Brent's 63 Council seats. I want to see how Brent Council with Green thinking delivers services in our borough.
