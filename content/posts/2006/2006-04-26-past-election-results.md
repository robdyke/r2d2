One sure-fire way of demonstrating that you have some skill with a computer is to generate a barchart from some data in a spreadsheet program like [Calc (in openoffice)](http://www.openoffice.org/ "Get it! It's FREE!") or a program from Microsoft. Both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives have got someone on their team that would pass a European Computer Driving License test no problem.

Both parties have proved that you can prove anything with stats.

[Brent last elected its Councillors in 2002](http://www.brent.gov.uk/elections.nsf/0/0cd698b19e0039cf80256ba0003211b5!OpenDocument&#038;ExpandView): long before the Iraq war, two (three?) Tory leaders ago, pre-Brown/Blue=Green, before Sarah Teather was elected to Brent East in 2003, before she was returned again in 2005 with an increased majority, before a Conservative and a Labour Councillor defected to the Liberal Democrats....
  
Brent Conservatives point out that in 2002 the Lib Dems came third. They do this as they believe that Team Orange are essentially a vote splitting party and that a Lib Dem vote lets in Labour by the back door. While Labour <strike>havn't got any spreadsheet skills</strike> are not publishing pretty graphs (yet), their position is the same: Vote Orange, Get Blue.

yet 2003 and 2005 have shown the people of Brent East that they can Vote Orange and Get Orange. Will Mapesbury, Queen's Park, Brondesbury and the other wards of Brent do the same on May the 4th?
