well tomorrow is the day when Brent will select its councillors. I've heard many a rumour (and started a few) and seen many a bun thrown. Could I call Mapesbury, Queen's Park or Brondesbury now? And the others in Brent East? Could I tell you have the council will look by Friday?

If you are into political betting then you'll have seen the odds offered by [one bookmaker](http://www.sportingodds.com). Here's the [Lib Dems story](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/303.html), bouyed as odds on them winning the council are slashed.

I do have a few thoughts - but its probably just subliminal psychic channelling; my prayers.

Want to see what I can do with a spreadsheet program? Coming right up.....
