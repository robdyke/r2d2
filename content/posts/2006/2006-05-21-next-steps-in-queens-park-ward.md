What news have I on the 'missing votes' in Queen's Park? Well, I know that all the candidates have been written to by Shahrar Ali who has appraised them of his calculations and his investigations with Brent Council. I imagine that the next steps will be to petition the Returning Officer through the High Court as the Officer does not have the power to choose to recount the ballot. More info as and when I've digested the papers from the Law Courts...

In the mean time I'm holding a bucket for Â£2 coins to be dropped in: a legal challenge isn't cheap! I'm encouraging donations for the fund. Click on the Donate! button. (pst...it's on the left, over there...)
