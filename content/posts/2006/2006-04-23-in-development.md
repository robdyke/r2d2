currently working on some mapping extensions to the Brent East Campaigning website. I plan to show a map of the Borough of Brent and to overlay various political informations such as the elected representatives for the wards both at local and national level. I'll begin with a map and just mash in some datasources that I will build myself. I need to build them by hand as Brent Council supply only a limited amount of information in machine readable format and what is made available in not geo-coded so it is unknown _where_ the information refers to.

when I've done with the basic overlays I'll drag in other information from places such as [QPARA](http://www.qpara.org), [brenteast.net](http://www.brenteast.net) [brentbrain](http://www.brentbrain.org.uk/) and display headlines from those sites as news feeds.

I will look at the wirelesslondon tools for building such a spaticalinformationportal and see if I can get them running.
