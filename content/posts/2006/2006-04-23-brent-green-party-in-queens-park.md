The local Greens have been distributing their literature in the wards. They have also made the literature available online so I don't have to scan it I can link to it from here.

Note that Shahrar Ali, candidate in Queen's Park, will appear in the the Green Party Election Broadcast on BBC 1 tomorrow (APR24) at 1845.
