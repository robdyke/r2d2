Last year [SKNDC](http://www.skndc.net/) advertised for interested parties to propose solutions for a wireless network project in South Kilburn. Comwifinet responded and we won the work. Yet the project was shelved as the budget for ICT in the Home ran out.

[SKFM](http://www.skfm.org.uk/), the community radio station broadcasting from the NDC area, is currently streaming to listeners over the internet. Listening to the stream reminded me of the community network project and I've begun to make contact with SKNDC again. Here's a [link to a presentation](http://open.comwifinet.com/projects/skndc/cwn_presentation_v1.html) I've prepared and begun to dsiitribute to people active in the SKNDC project. The presentation gives an introduction to community network projects and proposes some ideas and models for a community network in South Kilburn.
