PRAI, FOCI, BELD, ST, BLOG? read on.

I received a mail this afternoon from Tim at [Prater Raines Partners.](http://www.prai.co.uk/) PRAI are the people who developed [FOCI](http://www.prai.co.uk/foci/), the web content management system used by Sarah and the Brent Lib Dems.

Hi Tim.  ![-)](http://www.robdyke.com/stmp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

As CMS go, FOCI is pretty good. There are lots of functions: election graphs, opinion polls, online petitions. Although as I've not seen the user interface I can't comment on it's easy of use as a tool. I guess the [testimonials](http://www.prai.co.uk/foci/quotes.html) speak for that. Tim tells me that a survey function is being developed for FOCI and will be made available to all FOCI users as part of a continous program of enhancements, bug fixes and updates to the product.

And all for £50 to setup and £15 per month. First year costs? £230

But over at [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com), something very similar to FOCI is offered. For around £8 a month (depending on the strength of the Pound over the Dollar) you can get a hosted [Moveable Type](http://www.moveabletype.org/) webblog. And with a couple of months free thrown in if you pay for 12 months in advance, using Typepad would be £150 cheaper than FOCI!

Incidently, PRAI are the same company who are hosting [Jody Dunn's weblog](http://www.jodydunn.org.uk/) - powered by Moveable Type 3.01D.
