Or, how to give out the desired impression by using images.

In 2003, Sarah undertook a Residents Survey. The people of Brent were asked 50 questions on key-issues in a door to door survey. You can have a look at the PDF of the survey [here](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/resources/sites/217.160.173.25-3e678870b1c3f9.89263653/Sarah+Teather+MP%27s+Residents+Survey.pdf).

Take a look at the [photograph](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/images/sites/217.160.173.25-3e678870b1c3f9.89263653/6.jpeg) of Sarah and [Cllr Havard Hughes](http://www.brent.gov.uk/Democracy.nsf/200742b2d0c7ccaa80256a9400404f4c/0d54251da472eaed80256a960056bc6f!OpenDocument) with bulging post bag of responses that accompanies the [news post in June 2003](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/9.html).

Now have a look at the news post ['Sarah Says Thank You'](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/153.html) from the 16th of August 2004. Poor Havard, he doesn't get name checked this time.

Sarah describes this years response as overwhelming. Last year it was massive. Yet the visual aid is the same. Can't we get a photo of Sarah buried in survey responses?
