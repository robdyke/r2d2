This season, I shall mostly be looking forward to ['Team America: World Police'](http://www.teamamericamovie.com/).

[The Independent writes](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/news/story.jsp?story=547464) audiences should be prepared to “imagine the Thunderbirds fighting the war on Terror. Or, if you prefer, a Jerry Bruckheimer action-fest recast as a musical.” First peeks on the internet show Osama bin Laden adorned by naked nymphs, Mount Rushmore hiding the secret headquarters of “Team America” and Michael Moore covered in mustard with half eaten hot dogs in his hands. “...The most serious issues facing the White House and the world will be treated to a heavy dose of utter irreverence and gleeful comedy.”
