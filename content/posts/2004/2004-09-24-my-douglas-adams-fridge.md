You'll remember Sarah's campaign - it is highly memorable after all! Without a hit of sarcasam: when I am walking about Brent and I see the spoil that is illegal fly-tipping I think 'thats a grot spot that is'.

Well. I recently disposed the aging 1980s 75/25 Fridge/Ice Box monster that lurked in the corner of my kitchen and took delivery of two purring sleek shinning white replacements. So now I have the need for a ['Special Collection'](http://www.brent.gov.uk/Services.nsf/97adad6ff206607c8025663c0065c536/cfaa0e26946e23558025693d00358253!OpenDocument) from Brent's Street Care Team.

So, being the online gentleman about teh interweb, I browsed on over to [www.brent.gov.uk](http://www.brent.gov.uk). Navigation to the Street Care 'Bulky Item Collection' information page was easy - the website is award winning after all!. And what choice! I can telephone in my request OR complete an online form. The latter was completed rapidly.

And then I had to print off the form and send it back to the council. Bugger. Stalled at the final hurdle. And remember folks, [Brent People Do It Online](http://www.brent.gov.uk/news.nsf/0/85a1542c6b58f27b80256cf6005bcff3?OpenDocument) ran the poster campaign. Although it would appear that they also do it offline. So, that wonderful, quick and easy FREE communication method has to end up so last century - with a print out stuffed into an envelope and mailed with a second class stamp.

So, while Brent Council are pushing the [Big Brent Clean Up](http://www.brent.gov.uk/news.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/0cad590db7158b1180256ef50039fc3f?OpenDocument) and Sarah is asking for Grot Spots reports to clean up ["Labours Shame"](http://www.sarahteather.libdems.org.uk/photos/), my fridge is sitting on my driveway awaiting collection. I've submitted a request, and replied to the confirmation email sent by Brent Council with 'I don't a printer - what can I do?' message. let's see what happens!

(I guess I could always fly-tip it, send a photo to Sarah and time how long it takes to get disposed of....No, that would be illegal.
