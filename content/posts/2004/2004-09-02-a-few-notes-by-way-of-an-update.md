No response from my fax to Sarah last week. I'm sure she'll respond within the target timescale - maybe even bettering her average response time! (she currently responds to 42% of messages sent via FaxYourMP.com within 14 days).

There are some dates for your diary on the BELD website. Sarah Teather holds six advice surgeries a month you can find the times and venues [here](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/events/).

I'm just not going to pass comment on [this](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/155.html).

For my, my summer recess has arrived. I return on the 10th of September, just in time for Queen's Park Open Day on the 12th. I'll be running a stall. Stop by, find out what [this](http://qpwireless.blogspot.com/) is about.
