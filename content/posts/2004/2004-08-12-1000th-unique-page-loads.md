At 01:26 this morning, [sarah teather is my mp](http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com/) received its 1000th unique page load.

from the statcounter logs...

  * Users of the Parliament network can't type. They keep on ending up at the blog after searching for a miss-spelling of 'sarah teather is my mp'
  * Users who arrive at the site from search engine results have only used Google to search
  * Those working late on the Brent Council Network had fun with the "Google 'sarah teather' find the blog game" on Tuesday
