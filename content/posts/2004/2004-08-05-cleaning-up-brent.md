I am pleased to see Sarah [continuing to take action](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/147.html) on the street furniture left behind following the privatisation and deregulation the telecoms industry.

Announcing her actions, Sarah said:

> "Derelict phone boxes are an eyesore in Brent. Local residents are sick and tired of seeing them being used as rubbish bins, fly-poster sites and public toilets. I hope that local people show their frustration at these monstrosities by signing my petition."

Sign the petition!

There are three such eye-sores on my walk to work - I'll be signing.
