Last week, Sarah was [trumpeting the launch](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/146.html) of the 'Safer Neighbourhoods' initiative in Kilburn ward.

This week, she's [calling for action](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/news/152.htm) to tackle ticket touts in Kilburn ward.

Surely any action taken would be taken as part of the Safer Neighbourhoods initiative.

Having spoken last week about how the "...police are not allowed to get on with their job because of excessive paperwork", Sarah now wants to devote police time to persuing the small-fry petty-crook - with all the paper chase that accompanies it.

Tough on crime? Or tough on the causes of crime? It's not both. You only need to tackle one of them. Choose the right one.
