> Sarah thinks that the Council Tax is an unfair tax introduced by the Conservatives and made worse under Labour. Sarah wants to see the Council Tax scrapped and replaced with a fairer alternative based on a persons ability to pay.

> Sarah wants the Government to scrap Tuition fees and abandon its plans for top-up fees. Sarah belives that university fees are an 'unfair tax' on students.

> Sarah wants to clean up Brent. She has reported hundreds of cases of Labour neglect in our area to the council.

> Sarah wants to save Brent's Post Offices. Sarah is appalled that the Labour Government wants to close seven of our local Post Offices in Brent, as part of their scheme to close 3,000 across the country.
