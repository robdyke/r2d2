Available for download from Sarah's website is the LDs pre-manifesto "Freedom Fairness Trust'. It'll save you a £1 on buying it. Although as it is a 5.8MB PDF (with an estimated 17 minutes download at 56k) of 12 full colour pages, I wouldn't advise you print it...not with the [cost of inkjet printing](http://www.davidbowe.co.uk/press_releases/detail.php?pressReleaseId=12&currentPage=1).

But I would advise you read it; well, at least give the front page a glance and read the Ten Reason to vote Liberal Democrat. Here the LibDem's set out their 10 priorities and how they will pay for it; 'Our Policies Are Fully Costed'. 

  * Put patients first
  * Free personal care when you need it
  * No tuition fees, no top-up fees
  * More investment in children's early years
  * 10,000 more police on the steets
  * £25 more on the pension every week at 75
  * Free off-peak local transport
  * Axe the Council Tax
  * Restoring Trust: Anti-war
  * Take the environment seriously

> "We Liberal Democrats prize freedom of the individual, underpinned by a safety net for the vulnerable, in our society. We are defenders of the public services, free at the point of use. We are internationalist in outlook - pro UN, pro Commonwealth and pro Europe. Our Liberal background makes us wary of an over-mighty state and dedicated to civil liberties. We are enthusiasts for the green agenda" - Charles Kennedy

Now, that I can understand. But later in his introductory letter, Charles goes on about the LDs"new 'Tough Liberalism' agenda"? I don't know if I'd like to be on the receiving end of some 'Tough Liberalism'.

You can download it [here](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/resources/index/). And you could always comment on it, or any other Sarah Teather, _local Liberal Democrat MP_, related topic [here.](http://sarah-teather-mp.blogspot.com/)
