It was a busy Commons week for Sarah last week. Not content with appearing in Hoggart's Sketch...Sorry...Questioning the Prime Minister over a serious funding shortfall caused by the actions of Government, Sarah was also speaking up for Family Doctor services in Brent East on [Opposition Day](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/glossary/?gl=28).

Speaking of the impact of the Governments 48-hour first appointment target for GPs on the forward planning of appointments, [Sarah said](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-11-11.966.0) that despite repeated assurances from [Brent PCT](http://www.brentpct.nhs.uk/) that there would be no impact, patients were experiencing problems. Patients were not able to book follow-up appointments with the same doctor or schedule a non-urgent appointment at a time of their choosing.

Let us not forget that this government is all about choice.

[Sarah also highlighted](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2004-11-11.969.0) the problem of availability of suitable property for GPs to setup surgeries. In order to solve the problem of short supply doctors have had to resort to buying residential property and converting it for surgery use. Not exactly alleviating pressure on the short supply of property.
