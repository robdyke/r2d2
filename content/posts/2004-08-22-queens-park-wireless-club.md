Queen’s Park Wireless Club

Exists to further the development of a wireless network in the area of Queen’s Park, London NW6. The community owned Queen’s Park Wireless Club is simply intended to facilitate non-profit-making digital media and sharing of common services by subscribing members at very high (broadband) speeds (to mean in excess of 10,000 Kbits/sec). The network exists for the purposes of connecting the community and sharing resources together for the benefit of all in the locality.

Membership of the Queen’s Park Wireless Club shall be governed by agreement to the constitution of the club and the acceptable usage policy of the network. A joining fee is also payable, along with a monthly subscription.

We'll be at the Queen's Park Open Day on the 12th of September with comwifinet Limited, the not-for-profit social enterprise company supporting this project.
