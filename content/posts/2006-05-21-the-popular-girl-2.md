I've been reading more F Scott Fitzgerald recently as I've just discovered a collection of his short stories published by Hesperus. "[The Popular Girl](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843914034/qid=1148197034/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-2632728-9014812)" collects together 5 short stories, each a gem, each of which, with dazzling brilliance and sparkling wit, disects Fitzgerald's favourite topic: the American society-life. This came to mind this morning while I was digging in my visitor statistics for stats that stood out. The number one [incomming search term](http://my7.statcounter.com/project/standard/camefrom.php?project_id=618994&#38;PHPSESSID=ceeedc5a902152cf91ee36f95351fff3) (the query entered at a search engine that led someone to read this website) is Hayley Matthews. Popular Girl indeed.

Very little information about any of our Councillors on the internet, unless they happened to have been the Mayor or an MP. The Brent Council website lists limited contact information for each elected Council member, and the Brent Brain 'blogging Councillors' project had a limited pilot that does not appear to be running at this time. I recently worked with Neil Nerva to support him and the other Labour Councillors in Queen's Park in the adoption and use on some internet tools: then he wasn't re-elected so that internet based communications project has ground to a halt.

Hayley is a Brent Lib Dem, so why no information on her, or any of the other Brent Lib Dem councillors on the [BELD website](http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/)? The BELD site emphasises Sarah Teather over other elected members in Brent. With the Lib Dems now with the greatest number of seats in the Council, will we see an overhaul of the BELD website to communicate more from our Local Councillors and less from Sarah Teather? They've got www.sarahteather.org.uk for all the news from our MP after all!
