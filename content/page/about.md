The posts here are an amalgamation of all the blogs Iâ€™ve written since I started posting in 2004. Combined here are posts from the blogs [Sarah Teather Is My MP](/tags/sarah-teather), [Brent East Campaigning](/categories/brent-east-campaigning/) and [No Overall Control](categories/no-overall-control/) along with everything I wrote while studying for my BA Politics. Sorry for any dead links. More recent posts are about open source and technology in the NHS.
