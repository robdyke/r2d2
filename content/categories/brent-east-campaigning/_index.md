From 2004 to 2011 I blogged about the political machinations around Brent East and Brent Council. I began with a blog called "[Sarah Teather Is My MP](/tags/sarah-teather)", and later with a blog called "[Brent East Campaigning](/categories/brent-east-campaigning/)". I have an extensive archive of [campaign materials](/tags/leaflets/) from all the parties / candidates at the [2005](/tags/election-2005) and [2010](/tags/election-2010) general elections.
