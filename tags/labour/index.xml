The area has strong links with the Afro-Caribbean community which forms the ward&amp;rsquo;s ethnic majority.
Here are a few photos of the last remaining block on the Stonebridge Estate off Hillside, Brent.

The ex-Unisys building on Brentfield has been empty for well over a decade. In 1997 the owners were granted planning consent to convert the office blocks to a 330-bedroom hotel, add a new penthouse storey on front block facing North Circular Road, a new single-deck car park and new boundary wall.</description></item><item><title>A message from Ken Livingstone</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/02/a-message-from-ken-livingstone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2010 14:18:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/02/a-message-from-ken-livingstone/</guid><description>Shoring up the core vote, Ken Livingstone writes to Labour party voters/members in Brent Central. &amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t afford to have the country run like Brent Council.&amp;rdquo; Letter received in Mapesbury, 2nd May.

Labour Minister Dawn Butler has issued a legal apology to Sarah Teather for calling her a hypocrite over MPs’ expenses. Butler made the accusation while the running of Sarah Teather’s office was under investigation. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner later dropped the investigation because there were no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by Ms Teather.
This issue came up at the MapRA Hustings on Monday night.</description></item><item><title>Brent Labour - Mapesbury News</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/04/brent-labour-mapesbury-news/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2010 09:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/04/brent-labour-mapesbury-news/</guid><description>From your local Labour Action Team.
The theme of this newsletter is rubbish. Brent Labour argue that the charge made by the council for bulky refuse collection has lead to an increase in fly-tipping in Brent and pledge to &amp;lsquo;dump&amp;rsquo; the £25 charge if elected. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t inducement enough for you, they claim that cuts, CUTS!, will reduce the frequency of rubbish collection.
The main flytipping problem in Brent is caused by unscrupulous builder, dumping domestic building waste.</description></item><item><title>MP Sarah Cleared</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 18:29:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A letter of complaint against Sarah Teather was sent to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, supposedly from a man at an address in Brent.

&lt;p>6 April 2006&lt;/p>
&lt;p>QUEEN&amp;rsquo;S PARK TOWERBLOCK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people have been asking me about the Council&amp;rsquo;s plan to put a 26-storey towerblock on the car park next to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Station. The Council is not prepared to have an open public consultation about the proposal. My view is that the people who elected me as their councillor deserve to be informed about the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Council was in extensive pre-application talks with the proposed developer, Genesis, from at least the middle of 2004. In April 2005, the Council amended the planning guidance relating to the site to allow for a building of up to 20 storeys paving the way for Genesis&amp;rsquo;s planning application for a set of twin 26-storey towerblocks. The Council persuaded them to withdraw it in September 2005 due to the unexpected level of public opposition to the proposal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>where did the logo go?
