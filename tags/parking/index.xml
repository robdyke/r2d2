How many of us have been issued a ticket because of a simple honest mistake, like, say, scratching off the wrong day on a parking voucher in error, or perhaps forgetting to note your registration on a temporary residents permit? Well that&amp;rsquo;s me on both counts.</description></item><item><title>Parking tickets in Brent and the FoI Act</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/21/parking-tickets-in-brent-and-the-foi-act/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2006 05:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/21/parking-tickets-in-brent-and-the-foi-act/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shahrar Ali, a Green Party candidate at both this years local and last years national elections, sent me an email yesterday on a topic important to car-owners - Penalty Charge Notices, or, rather, f&amp;rsquo;ing-tickets, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of us refer to them. Shahrar told me about meeting Brent residents while campaigning during the local elections and a common gripe that came up - being issued with a ticket on a public holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He writes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Trouble is, &amp;ldquo;Restrictions apply on Bank Holidays&amp;rdquo; signage is to be found only on some of the posts as one enters the zone. But most people, reasonably in my view, take their cue from the signage in the bays - which without any explicit indication to the contrary they will assume does not apply on public holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent can&amp;rsquo;t have it both ways. Had the assumption not been justified there would hardly be a need for the additional signage. The trouble is these signs are not fit for purpose, ie. noticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s at issue? Nobody likes to get a fine at the best of times, but the suspicion is that signage has been erected to maximise the chances of catching people out and making a quick buck. That&amp;rsquo;s dishonest and only fuels resentment towards local government - increasing cynicsm and eroding trust in public or democratic institutions, moreover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
