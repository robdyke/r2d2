The NW2 Committee NW2 began in September 2007 as a group local residents who wanted to improve the sense of community in the Cricklewood area. As Carol Granger, Committee Chair, writes &amp;ldquo;The Association was founded first to try to improve the sense of community in the area and provide opportunities for people in the neighbourhood to get together, and to get to know each other and maybe help each other out; but also to improve the appearance of the area (litter, graffiti, etc); to try to improve relationships with Brent and the officers who look after services for the area; try to make sure Cricklewood didn&amp;rsquo;t stay the Cinderella of Brent / Barnet / Camden.</description></item><item><title>photos from the MapRA hustings last night.</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/20/photos-from-the-mapra-hustings-last-night./</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 19:35:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/20/photos-from-the-mapra-hustings-last-night./</guid><description>&lt;p>Bums on seats&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>

Having been very impressed by the collective action that MapRA have motived in their community around the Mapesbury Dell project and the purchase of old-fashioned, sorry, &amp;lsquo;heritage&amp;rsquo; street lights for some of the streets, I thought that a Community Wireless Broadband Network would have been something that the residents of Mapesbury may have been interested in working to acheive.</description></item><item><title>Mapesbury Residents Association AGM</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/mapesbury-residents-association-agm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2005 10:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/mapesbury-residents-association-agm/</guid><description>Those active in local civil society and engaged in their neighbourhood were out at St. Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s Church on Walm Lane on Thursday night for the Mapesbury Residents Association Annual General Meeting. MapRA is a large and active group of neighbours all commited to woking for the benefit of the Mapesbury community. Attendance from the membership of MapRA is good and the nave of church was full.
I had expected to see Sarah Teather there: She was there last year, speaking on some of the activities that she, as the local MP, had beeen working on with MapRA and other people from the neighbouorhood.</description></item></channel></rss>
