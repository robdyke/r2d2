The area has strong links with the Afro-Caribbean community which forms the ward&amp;rsquo;s ethnic majority.
Here are a few photos of the last remaining block on the Stonebridge Estate off Hillside, Brent. You can see the cleared land from recent demolition work in the foreground.</description></item><item><title>Dawn Butler&amp;#039;s hoarding at Unisys, Brentfield</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/05/dawn-butlers-hoarding-at-unisys-brentfield/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2010 13:44:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/05/dawn-butlers-hoarding-at-unisys-brentfield/</guid><description>Is back on its legs.

Only that is not Stonebridge. It&amp;rsquo;s Trellick Tower, 3miles down the road in Ladbroke Grove&amp;hellip;..

This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time Labour have had stock photography issues locally.</description></item><item><title>Dawn Butler hording advertising at Unisys, Brentfield.</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/04/butler-advertising-at-unisys-brentfield/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2010 12:20:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/04/butler-advertising-at-unisys-brentfield/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it&amp;rsquo;s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.&amp;rdquo; Wilson and Kelling, 1982.
A building like this?
The ex-Unisys building on Brentfield has been empty for well over a decade. In 1997 the owners were granted planning consent to convert the office blocks to a 330-bedroom hotel, add a new penthouse storey on front block facing North Circular Road, a new single-deck car park and new boundary wall.</description></item><item><title>Labour pay legal costs to Brent Lib Dems</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/01/labour-pay-legal-costs-to-brent-lib-dems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2010 11:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/01/labour-pay-legal-costs-to-brent-lib-dems/</guid><description>Brent councillor James Powney laments the threat and use of legal writ to silence debate, tending towards an environment where &amp;lsquo;legitimate freedom of speech could be restricted by self censorship.&amp;rsquo;
Legal writ has its strength though. When Brent Labour distributed a leaflet with false claims about Sarah Teather, the Brent Leb Dems took appropriate legal measures. In the face of the legal action, Labour have now admitted their story was false and agreed to pay the Lib Dems legal costs.</description></item><item><title>WB Times &amp;#039;Butler told to apologise&amp;#039;</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/23/wb-times-butler-told-to-apologise/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 23:41:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/23/wb-times-butler-told-to-apologise/</guid><description>Brent&amp;rsquo;s Labour Group formal apology for issuing leaflets with defamatory claims about Sarah Teather is on page 4 of the WB Times this week.</description></item><item><title>Butler issues full apology for Teather expenses smear</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/21/butler-issues-full-apology-for-teather-expenses-smear/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2010 19:15:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/21/butler-issues-full-apology-for-teather-expenses-smear/</guid><description>LibDem Voice has some news on Brent Centrals dirty politics.
Labour Minister Dawn Butler has issued a legal apology to Sarah Teather for calling her a hypocrite over MPs’ expenses. Butler made the accusation while the running of Sarah Teather’s office was under investigation. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner later dropped the investigation because there were no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by Ms Teather.
This issue came up at the MapRA Hustings on Monday night.</description></item></channel></rss>
