These announcements have spawned much discussion and debate - on EHI/HSJ/NHSHackday sites and at EHILive - which ranges in style and content from Chicken Licken to Richard Stallman.&lt;/p>

In this post I&amp;rsquo;m looking at where the direction for such support from NHS England is coming from and what &amp;lsquo;support&amp;rsquo; for open source solutions might actually mean.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
