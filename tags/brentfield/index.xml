If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it&amp;rsquo;s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.&amp;rdquo; Wilson and Kelling, 1982.
A building like this?
The ex-Unisys building on Brentfield has been empty for well overÂ a decade. In 1997 the owners were granted planning consent to convert the office blocks to a 330-bedroom hotel, add a new penthouse storey on front block facing North Circular Road, a new single-deck car park and new boundary wall.</description></item></channel></rss>
