To create our distribution we use tools from the Ubuntu ecosystem to package our customisations and build the download images. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the techniques and tools we use for this.
Customisations Our core customisations are handled using a template from the ubuntu-default-settings package. This template allows us to easily set defaults for the look and feel of the desktop as well as tailoring the packages included in the installation.</description></item><item><title>Apperta Foundation supports NHSbuntu development</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-foundation-supports-nhsbuntu-development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-foundation-supports-nhsbuntu-development/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to be able to announce that the Apperta Foundation, (which was formerly the NHS England Open Source Programme) has agreed to provide NHSbuntu with initial support funding of £40k, in order to facilitate the initial few work packages required for NHSbuntu&amp;rsquo;s next few steps.
Details of the work packages will be published shortly, and we are of course open to community suggestions for future work packages. Initially we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on setting up good tooling for reproducible automated builds of NHSbuntu, and adding some new features.</description></item><item><title>NHS urged to consider Microsoft alternatives following cyber attacks</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/nhs-urged-to-consider-microsoft-alternatives-following-cyber-attacks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/nhs-urged-to-consider-microsoft-alternatives-following-cyber-attacks/</guid><description>Jon Hoeksma interviewed us about NHSbuntu for Digital Health.
In the wake of Friday’s international cyber attacks, which caused widespread disruption across NHS organisations, a small team of developers is recommending the health service reduce its reliance on Microsoft.
The NHS almost exclusively uses Microsoft operating systems, some of which – like Windows XP – are no longer officially supported.
To demonstrate that there is a licence-free alternative, GP Marcus Baw and technologist Rob Dyke have adapted the open source Linux-based Ubuntu operating system specifically for the NHS.</description></item><item><title>JoinUp Open source observatory report on NHSbuntu</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/joinup-open-source-observatory-report-on-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/joinup-open-source-observatory-report-on-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>Gijs Hillenius wrote about NHSbuntu for the Open Source Observatory.
A group of British IT health care specialists have tailored the Ubuntu Linux distribution for use by the UK’s national health service (NHS) on its workstations. The alpha version of NHSbuntu was unveiled at the South West CIO Forum on 27 April.
The advantages of NHSbuntu over proprietary PC operating systems include security, speed, costs and freedom. Using NHSbuntu will also enable NHS organisations to run up-to-date versions of browsers, creating an environment in which innovation can flourish, the developers say.</description></item><item><title>SxSW CIO &amp; CCIO Show and Tell</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-cio-ccio-show-and-tell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-cio-ccio-show-and-tell/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Why NHSbuntu?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>Look.

In this post I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the role of governance and community around open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the Safer Hospitals, Safer Wards Technology Fund announced in June of this year, &lt;a href="http://garymcallisteronline.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/open-source-in-nhs.html">Gary McAllister posted a comment piece&lt;/a> which neatly summarises key criteria of open source which I paraphrase here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The code should be freely available online, well-documented and accessible. It should be evident from the code repository that regular commits are made to the project from multiple sources, demonstrating that the code-base is active.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The licensing for the code should utilise an &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; license. Examples of licenses which meet the Open Source Initiative definition of open source can be seen here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A project should have corporate investment and a viable service provider clearly backing the product. This may sound counter intuitive but in order for an Open solution to be viable long-term it needs backing from a corporate entity. Without corporate backing the solution is &amp;ldquo;unsupported&amp;rdquo; and there is little evidence to ensure continued development. You could end up with a stale loaf of bread.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This last week I was at EHI Live with HANDI and Tactix4. HANDI were producing one of the streams at this exhibition &amp;lsquo;The HANDI Health Apps Conference&amp;rsquo;. HANDI Health Apps is the first national conference dedicated to health &amp;amp; social care apps and lightweight digital tools to take place in the UK.  It was a “must attend” event for app developers, health and care professionals, managers and commissioners who are seeking to understand how this new generation of digital tools can support the delivery of efficient, patient centred care. The conference included the HANDI-App Village located right in the centre of the EHI Live Exhibition providing a unique platform where health and care app developers can showcase their products without getting lost amongst the large stands of the major IT vendors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we had a village pub, serving real beer and excellent pork scratchings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it was a good idea to &amp;lsquo;live code&amp;rsquo; an app. In hind sight it was a good idea to &amp;lsquo;live code&amp;rsquo; an app and, except for the failure of the internet link, it would have worked well. Thankfully, as a child of Blue Peter, I had an app that I had made earlier prepared and ready installed on my device. With this APK file I was able to demo an app that scanned a barcode containing a URL and launch a browser. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/WWScan-QR.apk">APK&lt;/a> and here is the &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/EhiLive.png">QR code&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EHI Healthcare IT Champion 2013</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2013/06/27/ehi-healthcare-it-champion-2013/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:40:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2013/06/27/ehi-healthcare-it-champion-2013/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been nominated for EHI Healthcare IT Champion 2013.

We worked on a project called &lt;a href="http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/AsKit">AsKiT&lt;/a> which came second. It was great to collaborate with others from NHS organisations to create problem solving code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**The Problem: **All throughout the NHS there are a myriad of forms, questionnaires and assessments that need to be done, and the vast majority of them are done on paper, with the results stored in a folder in a cabinet or later scanned in and saved as a pdf file. Neither of these solutions allows ready access to the information in a digital form, and does not provide any of the benefits of digital capture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution:&lt;/strong> By creating a general-purpose question asking android app we have removed the need for the paper part of the process, now the questions are displayed on the screen and the results are captured digitally. It is no longer possible to write something that is illegible, or answers a numerical question with letters, or forget to answer certain questions. The results are then sent securely to the server where they are stored and can be forwarded directly to the appropriate system for further use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A few notes on the enthusiasm around healthcare IT</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/07/06/a-few-notes-on-the-enthusiasm-around-healthcare-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2012 12:55:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/07/06/a-few-notes-on-the-enthusiasm-around-healthcare-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a renewed vigor in healthcare IT.

&lt;p>The winning development, called ‘Patient List’, aimed to improve the handover of patients and replace the traditional task-list methods usually employed by doctors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Patient List problem is felt by every junior doctor in the NHS, but it was formally raised by Wai Keong Wong in a blog post titled &lt;a href="http://blog.openhealthcare.org.uk/?p=66">&amp;ldquo;Give every doctor an extra 30mins/day with patients&lt;/a> by solving the &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nhshackday/8JAwPEQbJbk/discussion">‘Patient List’ problem&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;. In summary, a system is needed to save junior doctors from error-prone manual daily work compiling lists of patients and their treatments for their daily rounds. Furthermore, the system should include task lists for each patient and a way to manage transfer of tasks between shifts and departments so that nothing gets forgotten during handover.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cough up the hairball and make NHS technology open</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2011/08/05/cough-up-the-hairball-and-make-nhs-technology-open/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2011 16:10:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2011/08/05/cough-up-the-hairball-and-make-nhs-technology-open/</guid><description>Here is a piece co-authored by me published in the Guardian Healthcare Network on open source in the NHS.

Rather than write anything more (that you won&amp;rsquo;t read) about dotgotlabs, here is a &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/21720640">video produced to explain the project&lt;/a> &amp;hellip; including me and others with great faces for radio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With interests in open source, open standards and interoperability and with experience in and around the NHS, I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to many solutions posted in the Healthcare challenge.  I&amp;rsquo;ve commented on the &lt;a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/interop/making">interoperability&lt;/a> challenges facing &amp;lsquo;Solutions&amp;rsquo; such as &amp;lsquo;Give Patients Access to Data&amp;rsquo; (a challenge involving &lt;a href="http://www.patientopinion.org.uk/">Patient Opinion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.mydex.org">MyDex&lt;/a>, see previous post on &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/noc/2011/03/24/brent-council-to-allow-residents-to-manage-their-personal-data/">Brent Council opening up resident data access&lt;/a>) and on the use of social media in healthcare solutions &amp;hellip; and the &lt;a href="http://mmt.me.uk/blog/2010/11/21/nhs-and-tracking/">privacy implications&lt;/a> there in&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing heavily to a solution posted by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timknight">Tim Knight&lt;/a> which proposed greater use of open source practices in the NHS - provisionally titled &lt;a href="https://dotgovlabs.direct.gov.uk/Page/ViewIdea?ideaid=1293">Open Me Project&lt;/a> (login req; email me for invitation).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of the solution is to provide a framework and supporting tools for the collaborative development of open source solutions for NHS organisations and commercial healthcare providers. The solution has been voted up to progress from &amp;lsquo;Buzz&amp;rsquo; stage to &amp;lsquo;Teaming&amp;rsquo; stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of the incubation process for solutions, DotGovLabs have engaged the support of Experts from Departments of state and the Private Sector to give feedback and pose challenging questions to teams. This weekend &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=18009701">David Ostler&lt;/a>, Chairman of unitedHealth posted feedback on our solution and several others.  I thought I would repost the exchange here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lib Dems choose open-source and free software</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/10/04/lib-dems-choose-open-source-and-free-software/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2008 14:34:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/10/04/lib-dems-choose-open-source-and-free-software/</guid><description>According to Publictechnology.net, the Liberal Democrats have decided to go for Open Source software for organisational infrastructure.

Abstract: The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. In this paper, I show how philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have engendered new forms of socio-political consumption and new political economies of meaning. My emphasis on the interplay between the local and the global/structure and agency, shows new ways of &amp;lsquo;thinking&amp;rsquo; the cosmopolitan, sedimented in the interconnected networks of the technical age.</description></item><item><title>dissertation project - reviewed and replanned</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-project-reviewed-and-replanned/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2008 15:26:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-project-reviewed-and-replanned/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy reviewing and replanning my dissertation project - only five weeks to go until hand-in!

Wiki&amp;rsquo;s, along with blogs, are a prominent feature of the contemporary easy to read, easy to edit web. The term wiki is derived from the Hawaiian word for quick. Wiki&amp;rsquo;s are websites that are quick and easy to contribute to and to edit. The software purchased, Confluence, is merely an implementation of the wiki idea, corporatised, privatised and packaged up as an &amp;lsquo;enterprise level collaboration tool&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>research proposal for my politics degree</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/11/02/research-proposal-for-my-politics-degree/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2007 14:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/11/02/research-proposal-for-my-politics-degree/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I get to write a dissertation for my degree course.

I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring what other ways the information that is stored in the library building can opened up to the benefit of students and staff alike. I&amp;rsquo;m not so much speaking about new things that the library can do, rather I am interested in ways in which existing services and resources could be linked up, extending their use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently recommendations for reading / viewing / listening are distributed to students as files to download from &lt;a href="http://learn.gold.ac.uk" title="Goldsmiths Virtual Learnign Environment website">learn.gold.ac.uk&lt;/a> (which we usually print) or in hard copy (which we then annotate). Students then navigate to the library website to find out whether a given publication is &lt;em>even available&lt;/em>, and what its shelfmark is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is the potential to make the process of recommending, finding, borrowing and even commenting on the value and relevance of a particular library resource more seamless by linking-up the library website and learn.gold site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drupal for IP Community commission</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/01/16/drupal-for-ip-community-commission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2006 18:57:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/01/16/drupal-for-ip-community-commission/</guid><description>Read the Drupal README if you want to know what it is.
