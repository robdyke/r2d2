The entire NHSbuntu/NHoS team (4 core members) have been working as volunteers, with a few small work packages and pieces of funding courtesy of the Apperta Foundation, but we have received absolutely zero backing from those higher up in NHS Digital and other NHS organisations.</description></item><item><title>NHSCIO Show and Tell</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/10/10/nhscio-show-and-tell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/10/10/nhscio-show-and-tell/</guid><description>Here are the materials I shared with [https://twitter.com/nhscio](NHS CIO Will Smart) and Alex Chaplin in October.

I&amp;rsquo;d like you to accept this post with our apologies for being relatively quiet recently. Now, without further ado, here’s an update on all things NHSbuntu.  A winning hack In the news A spot of bother Working with us What’s coming up A winning hack. Back in June we were invited to join the NHS Digital Delivery Team for a Hack Week.</description></item><item><title>Making NHSbuntu</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/06/19/making-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/06/19/making-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>NHSbuntu is built for the NHS from the Ubuntu open source operating system. To create our distribution we use tools from the Ubuntu ecosystem to package our customisations and build the download images. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the techniques and tools we use for this.
Customisations Our core customisations are handled using a template from the ubuntu-default-settings package. This template allows us to easily set defaults for the look and feel of the desktop as well as tailoring the packages included in the installation.</description></item><item><title>Apperta Foundation supports NHSbuntu development</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-supports-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-supports-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to be able to announce that the Apperta Foundation, (which was formerly the NHS England Open Source Programme) has agreed to provide NHSbuntu with initial support funding of £40k, in order to facilitate the initial few work packages required for NHSbuntu&amp;rsquo;s next few steps.
Details of the work packages will be published shortly, and we are of course open to community suggestions for future work packages. Initially we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on setting up good tooling for reproducible automated builds of NHSbuntu, and adding some new features.</description></item><item><title>NHS urged to consider Microsoft alternatives following cyber attacks</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/digitalhealth-net/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/digitalhealth-net/</guid><description>Jon Hoeksma interviewed us about NHSbuntu for Digital Health.
In the wake of Friday’s international cyber attacks, which caused widespread disruption across NHS organisations, a small team of developers is recommending the health service reduce its reliance on Microsoft.
The NHS almost exclusively uses Microsoft operating systems, some of which – like Windows XP – are no longer officially supported.
To demonstrate that there is a licence-free alternative, GP Marcus Baw and technologist Rob Dyke have adapted the open source Linux-based Ubuntu operating system specifically for the NHS.</description></item><item><title>JoinUp Open source observatory report on NHSbuntu</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/OSOR-EU/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/OSOR-EU/</guid><description>Gijs Hillenius wrote about NHSbuntu for the Open Source Observatory.
A group of British IT health care specialists have tailored the Ubuntu Linux distribution for use by the UK’s national health service (NHS) on its workstations. The alpha version of NHSbuntu was unveiled at the South West CIO Forum on 27 April.
The advantages of NHSbuntu over proprietary PC operating systems include security, speed, costs and freedom. Using NHSbuntu will also enable NHS organisations to run up-to-date versions of browsers, creating an environment in which innovation can flourish, the developers say.</description></item><item><title>SxSW CIO &amp; CCIO Show and Tell</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-show-and-tell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-show-and-tell/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Why NHSbuntu?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>Look. It’s time we talked about something. NHSland has a problem. A debt problem. A technical debt problem of immense proportions. We’re friends. We can talk about this. Openly. We want to help.
Beveridge identified Five ‘Giant Evils’. We’ve also identified five giants. Five giant factors that compound the technical debt in NHSland: Security, Legacy, Speed, Cost, Freedom. Beveridge’s work was instrumental in establishing the NHS. And we love the NHS.</description></item></channel></rss>
