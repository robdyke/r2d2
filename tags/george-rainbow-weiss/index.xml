You can&amp;rsquo;t have missed it: it was an A3 sheet of paper folded to A4 and covered with text. What was curious about the materials was the lack of photographs - no pic of Rainbow George, no pic of Tony Bush and George Blair.
A preferendum is an experiment in participatory democracy. The Vote for Yourself Rainbow Dream Ticket party is encouraging the electorate to vote not only for their candidate but also for the policies of the party should it be elected to form a government.</description></item><item><title>Linkup for George 'Rainbow' Weiss</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/linkup-for-george-rainbow-weiss/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2005 09:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/linkup-for-george-rainbow-weiss/</guid><description>Thanks to a reader, here are some links for the Vote For Yourself Dream Ticket Party and George &amp;lsquo;Rainbox&amp;rsquo; Weiss.

The Guardian website also lists George &amp;lsquo;Rainbow&amp;rsquo; Weiss, but not as a candidate in this election (they need to get that page of their site updated).</description></item></channel></rss>
