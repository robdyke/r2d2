A building like this?
The ex-Unisys building on Brentfield has been empty for well over a decade.

The theme of this newsletter is rubbish. Brent Labour argue that the charge made by the council for bulky refuse collection has lead to an increase in fly-tipping in Brent and pledge to &amp;lsquo;dump&amp;rsquo; the £25 charge if elected. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t inducement enough for you, they claim that cuts, CUTS!, will reduce the frequency of rubbish collection.
The main flytipping problem in Brent is caused by unscrupulous builder, dumping domestic building waste.</description></item><item><title>FUD review for July</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/08/08/fud-review-for-july/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2006 07:35:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/08/08/fud-review-for-july/</guid><description>FUD?

Received the first campaign materials from Team YellowGold and Team Red since the elections for local government in May. Sorry for the blue tint on the scans, I think my scanner is broken.
The BELD are thanking people for voting for them in Mapesbury and give people the contact numbers of their new local councillors. I won&amp;rsquo;t reprint them here though - surely you can get them from Brent Council (after 6 or 7 clicks) or from the BELD website (well actually you can&amp;rsquo;t find any info about your local councillors or FOCUS TEAM on the BELD website).</description></item><item><title>Brent Conservatives leave the office - SHOCK!</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/03/brent-conservatives-leave-the-office-shock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2006 16:40:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/03/brent-conservatives-leave-the-office-shock/</guid><description>I was emailed a copy of the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Conservative Action Team campaign materials yesterday.

Andrew Gilligan was writing in Friday 29th Evening Standard. I picked up the most recent flyer - literally, there were some floating around the platform at Kilburn, Jubilee Line - in the early evening on Friday.</description></item><item><title>Campaign Materials - Labour</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/29/campaign-materials-labour/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2005 10:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/29/campaign-materials-labour/</guid><description>I commented that there would be more on the Labour Party Brent East News &amp;lsquo;Delivering For You&amp;rsquo;.
One thing I noticed was that Tony (Blair not Benn) doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature on the campaign material. There are three photos of Ken &amp;lsquo;Red&amp;rsquo; Livingstone - Labours prodigal son - and a photo of Tony Benn (Old &amp;lsquo;Old Labour&amp;rsquo; - sorry Tony) in that upright but slightly reclined pose that he does so well. Another Old Labour party member, Diane Abbot, is quoted in support of Yasmin.</description></item><item><title>Campaign Materials - Many!</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/27/campaign-materials-many/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2005 11:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/27/campaign-materials-many/</guid><description>More campaign materials from Sarah Teather.

I read the whole of the Ken Livingstone interview on the London Labour Party website. Campaigning in Brent East with Yasmin Qureshi Ken said:&amp;ldquo;I am delighted that my first election visit is in my old seat of Brent East, where human rights campaigner Yasmin Qureshi is in pole position to become Britain&amp;rsquo;s first ever Asian woman.&amp;rdquo;
The &amp;lsquo;round robin&amp;rsquo; makes four mentions of Yasmin&amp;rsquo;s ethnicity and gender.</description></item><item><title>Fifty extra police officers in Brent</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/27/fifty-extra-police-officers-in-brent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2005 10:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/27/fifty-extra-police-officers-in-brent/</guid><description>I picked up a copy of Brent East News published by Yasmin and the BE Labour Party when in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park on Monday. Under the headline &amp;lsquo;Delivering for You&amp;rsquo; there is a photo of three police officers with a caption &amp;lsquo;Brent now has more than fifty extra police officers&amp;rsquo;.
Fifty Extra Police on Brent streetsYasmin Qureshi&amp;rsquo;s police, beating round the bush.
Fifty extra police officers! Shame that three of the fifty extra police officers in Brent East are on walkabout in Shepherds Bush.</description></item><item><title>Campaign Materials - Green Party</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/12/campaign-materials-greens/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2005 02:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/12/campaign-materials-greens/</guid><description>Brent East Green News - A4 newsletter - Front Page - JPG
