The former New Heights Furniture Shop in Cricklewood Broadway has been taken over by a supermarket called Way–2–Save. They have a branch in Neasden which has very good range of food, fresh fruit and veg and a halal butchers which would add to the choices for supermarket shopping in the area in a positive way.</description></item><item><title>North West Two</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/07/24/north-west-two/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2008 08:55:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/07/24/north-west-two/</guid><description>The website of my neighbourhood&amp;rsquo;s residents association, North West Two, is now up and running.

&amp;ldquo;The rumour and subsequent petition started after a report which recommended library closures was released into the public domain. This report was based on a strategy to libraries that was agreed under the previous Labour administration.
The current executive have rejected this plan and asked for a new strategy to be written. I understand that the new strategy will not recommend library closures. The new draft library strategy should be published in the next few weeks.</description></item><item><title>Cricklewood Library</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2007 08:46:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</guid><description>I have heard rumors locally about the closure of Cricklewood library and today signed a petition, organised by Friends of Cricklewood Library to keep it open.

On Friday last week I saw a member of the Brent Council Street Care team out ward walking in Mapesbury. He was monitoring the recycling collection from both the kerb side boxes and the green wheelie bins - check we residents were using the service and using it correctly? checking up on the contractors? don&amp;rsquo;t know - either way his purpose was to be highly visible in the ward. Suit, yellow jacket, Brent Council Street Care printed on the back in big letters? A visibility exercise in the ward prior to the ward hustings tomorrow and the Mapesbury Residents Associations (MAPRA) Annual General Meeting?That&amp;rsquo;s probably just the skeptic in me&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;but then this afternoon&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Queen's Park Tower Plan</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/23/queens-park-tower-plan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2006 16:01:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/23/queens-park-tower-plan/</guid><description>The proposal for the tower block in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park is a lead topic for each of the parties contesting the electoral ward of Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park. For Labour it is getting like the Monty Python topic not to be mentioned in front of our hosts for the World Cup. The Lib Dems have made great gains from this thread - well, a sitting (yet not restanding) Councillor defected to Team Yellow with the tower plan as a key issue.</description></item><item><title>Will Brent Vote Blue and Go Green?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/19/will-brent-vote-blue-and-go-green/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2006 14:12:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/19/will-brent-vote-blue-and-go-green/</guid><description>Are you serious?
Each day I walk from Mapesbury to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park via Brondesbury/Kilburn wards - sounds like a round about route but I&amp;rsquo;m just walking cross the boundry corners. In contrast to the General Election last year there are not many posters out on display in gardens and in the shop windows in support of ANY political party up for election in May. However I have noticed that of the posters that are on display the Green&amp;rsquo;s and the Liberal Democrats have strong support.</description></item><item><title>where did the logo go?

What was intersting was the lack of a logo. These materials where not branded Labour - the logos and the slogunogos were missing too.&lt;/p>

The national political story was the continued opposition to the ID card legislation by Sarah Teather and the Liberal Democrats. The newsletter also covered the story of the comments made by Labour Cllr Jonathan Davies on the &amp;lsquo;consultation&amp;rsquo; over the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Tower plans.</description></item><item><title>an evening with Rt Hon Charles Clarke</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/10/an-evening-with-rt-hon-charles-clarke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2006 17:02:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/10/an-evening-with-rt-hon-charles-clarke/</guid><description>receiving this letter was one of the prompts to get me back blogging again - an evening with Charles Clarke.

LD Focus On Mapesbury March 2006
The BELDs expect that a Labour council would again increase council taxes significantly after the local elections. The LDs (as we know) propose a &amp;lsquo;fairer system&amp;rsquo; of local income taxation.</description></item></channel></rss>
