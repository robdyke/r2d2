Well, I know that all the candidates have been written to by Shahrar Ali who has appraised them of his calculations and his investigations with Brent Council. I imagine that the next steps will be to petition the Returning Officer through the High Court as the Officer does not have the power to choose to recount the ballot.

There is no way that Shahrar could have seen all the ballot papers in for the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park ward, but he did witness the first sort and count of the block votes and also the count of the &amp;lsquo;splits&amp;rsquo; and the paper with unallocated votes.</description></item><item><title>Missing votes in Queen's Park ward?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/12/missing-votes-in-queens-park/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2006 18:05:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/12/missing-votes-in-queens-park/</guid><description>Did those of you who stood up to be counted on May 4th get counted?
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent today researching the process for the counting of ballots and gathering information on the election result in Brent as I believe that there is cause for concern over the result returned in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park ward. My concern centres on the counting of ballot papers with unallocated votes. let me explain&amp;hellip;
You each had three votes on your ballot paper.</description></item><item><title>And our winners are....</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/05/and-our-winners-are/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2006 05:05:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/05/05/and-our-winners-are/</guid><description>Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park, Mapesbury and Brondesbury have all turned Yellow - congratulations to the Cllrs in these wards.

Each day I walk from Mapesbury to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park via Brondesbury/Kilburn wards - sounds like a round about route but I&amp;rsquo;m just walking cross the boundry corners. In contrast to the General Election last year there are not many posters out on display in gardens and in the shop windows in support of ANY political party up for election in May. However I have noticed that of the posters that are on display the Green&amp;rsquo;s and the Liberal Democrats have strong support.</description></item><item><title>Tower Politics</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/19/tower-politics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2006 03:51:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/19/tower-politics/</guid><description>Over at stopthetower a recent email news update has been posted by Barney Cokeliss.

&lt;p>6 April 2006&lt;/p>
&lt;p>QUEEN&amp;rsquo;S PARK TOWERBLOCK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people have been asking me about the Council&amp;rsquo;s plan to put a 26-storey towerblock on the car park next to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Station. The Council is not prepared to have an open public consultation about the proposal. My view is that the people who elected me as their councillor deserve to be informed about the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Council was in extensive pre-application talks with the proposed developer, Genesis, from at least the middle of 2004. In April 2005, the Council amended the planning guidance relating to the site to allow for a building of up to 20 storeys paving the way for Genesis&amp;rsquo;s planning application for a set of twin 26-storey towerblocks. The Council persuaded them to withdraw it in September 2005 due to the unexpected level of public opposition to the proposal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brent Labour Councillor Jonathan Davies has joined the Liberal Democrats</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/12/brent-labour-councillor-jonathan-davies-has-joined-the-liberal-democrats/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2006 07:48:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/12/brent-labour-councillor-jonathan-davies-has-joined-the-liberal-democrats/</guid><description>Brent Labour Councillor Jonathan Davies has joined the Liberal Democrats reports the BELD website.
&amp;ldquo;I have realised that the beliefs I stand for such as the safeguarding of our civil liberties, international justice and a free and fair society are best represented within the Liberal Democrats.&amp;rdquo;
Also connected to Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s feelings over the proposed development of a tower block in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park ? : &amp;ldquo;The issue of Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Tower is a classic example of Brent Labour in action.</description></item><item><title>calling it as you see it</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/09/calling-it-as-you-see-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2006 12:08:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/09/calling-it-as-you-see-it/</guid><description>Brent Lib Dems have been redistributing the comments made by Labour Cllr for Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Jonathan Davies on the governance and effectiveness of Brents&amp;rsquo; Labour Council.
I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that Cllr Davies has the ability to speak his own mind and to make judgements based on his observations. His views on the consultation around the proposed development consisting of a tower block in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park will chime with many in the local area.</description></item><item><title>Queen's Park Labour</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/09/queens-park-labour/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2006 04:11:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/04/09/queens-park-labour/</guid><description>ever wanted to know who your queen&amp;rsquo;s park labour action team are? me too. I picked up this flyer in queen&amp;rsquo;s park ward in early march. The snap shows Cllrs Neil Nerva, Helga Gladbaum and Reg Freeson campaigning for safer stations and more police in
queen&amp;rsquo;s park.
I wonder if their campaigning will be rewarded in on May 4th? Do people feel their stations are unsafe? Does queen&amp;rsquo;s park need more police?</description></item></channel></rss>
