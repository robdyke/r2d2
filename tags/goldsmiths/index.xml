Abstract: The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. In this paper, I show how philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have engendered new forms of socio-political consumption and new political economies of meaning. My emphasis on the interplay between the local and the global/structure and agency, shows new ways of &amp;lsquo;thinking&amp;rsquo; the cosmopolitan, sedimented in the interconnected networks of the technical age.</description></item><item><title>self-publishing of recent essays</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/20/self-publishing-of-recent-essays/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 16:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/20/self-publishing-of-recent-essays/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve converted some of my recent papers into web pages for easy reading online.

Here is my New Radical Political Economy paper on social, peer-to-peer, participatory financial models. In the paper I contrast traditional banks and interest bearing capital transactions to these emergent models. Here is the web HTML version, and this is the PDF version for download.</description></item><item><title>new radical political economy</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/04/13/new-radical-political-economy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2008 16:43:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/04/13/new-radical-political-economy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished a paper on social, peer-to-peer, participatory financial models. In the paper I contrast traditional banks and interest bearing capital transactions to these emergent models. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at three different examples of these new business models, Zopa, Kiva and Open Capital, considering to what extent these organisations are challenging established practices.
The full paper is available as a PDF. As soon as I&amp;rsquo;ve got my LaTeX/HTML conversion working I&amp;rsquo;ll post that too.</description></item><item><title>dissertation book print project</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-book-print-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2008 15:40:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-book-print-project/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating the feasibility of collecting and publishing final year dissertation projects in book form. I think that this will make a great reminder of our time of study, our political alliances and the friendships that have grown over the years at Goldsmiths. Also it&amp;rsquo;s such an indulgent, gratuitous act: So Fucking Goldsmiths. My plan is to gather together our dissertations and publish a book (ISBN record and everything) of our works to have it printed and ready for graduation in September.</description></item><item><title>dissertation project - reviewed and replanned</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-project-reviewed-and-replanned/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2008 15:26:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/22/dissertation-project-reviewed-and-replanned/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy reviewing and replanning my dissertation project - only five weeks to go until hand-in!

Well damm representative governance, that&amp;rsquo;s what I say.
ULU do get several points awarded for a sensible and secure electronic voting mechanism. You can vote from this page, online and confidentialy, assuming that you have got a username and password that have been emailed to your ULU College Email account.
How did they do such a thing you may ask&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Some colleges in the UoL will provide ULU with a database of the students who are eligible to vote in the elections from that college.</description></item><item><title>How I would have rigged the Goldsmiths College Student Elections...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/26/how-i-would-have-rigged-the-goldsmiths-college-student-elections/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2008 10:03:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/26/how-i-would-have-rigged-the-goldsmiths-college-student-elections/</guid><description>&lt;p>How I would have rigged the Goldsmiths College Student Elections and some recommendations for the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many ways of rigging an election and, with increased abstraction and dispersal of the act of voting, influencing the outcome of ballots gets easier and easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s just think for a moment what takes place when a student votes. First of all, the student needs to be co-present with the ballot! This is a given and the only part of the process that can not be virtualised. The student presents some ID before being given a ballot paper. The ballot is privately completed and cast into the ballot box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Goldsmiths College Students Election e-Voting was extremely vulnerable to exploitation by someone with malicious intent. The e-voting mechanism virtualised the ballot paper instead of virtualising the whole process. Anyone visiting the goldsmithsstudents.com website was able to download a Microsoft Word file. This file used a macro to capture the input of the user; in this case the ranking of the preference of candidates. A student was expected to complete the form, save it, then send the file as an attachment from their college email account to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="mailto:su@gold.ac.uk">su@gold.ac.uk&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most vulnerable part of the whole process is that &lt;strong>single file&lt;/strong> made available for public download.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On puting the effort in...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/25/on-puting-the-effort-in/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2008 12:11:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/25/on-puting-the-effort-in/</guid><description>By the Gods!

Others would see Goldsmiths twin with an Israeli institution and have brought out the votes to defeat motions in the past. Both condemn the other for their solidarity, their morality (or lack of it), their inequity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

Wiki&amp;rsquo;s are websites that are quick and easy to contribute to and to edit.

&lt;p>The program monitoring program at goldsmiths has recently changed to a new model. This arrangement uses online tools to compliment the traditional Course Rep role to set an agenda for a number of meetings over the course of the college year between the academic staff and the students. As a Program Monitoring Rep I was at the first of the meetings today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was an agenda. These are my reflections on that meeting. Disclaimer. I would probably say all of the following again. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it anything more than my opinion. The official minutes may more accurately reflect actual events. Mileage may vary. Terms and Conditions Apply. Offers not available to those outside the EU.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>extending `smiths library services</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/extending-smiths-library-services/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 23:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/extending-smiths-library-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>Goldsmiths SU has successfully campaigned for changes in the opening hours of the colleges library and ICT facilities. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring what other ways the information that is stored in the library building can opened up to the benefit of students and staff alike. I&amp;rsquo;m not so much speaking about new things that the library can do, rather I am interested in ways in which existing services and resources could be linked up, extending their use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently recommendations for reading / viewing / listening are distributed to students as files to download from &lt;a href="http://learn.gold.ac.uk" title="Goldsmiths Virtual Learnign Environment website">learn.gold.ac.uk&lt;/a> (which we usually print) or in hard copy (which we then annotate). Students then navigate to the library website to find out whether a given publication is &lt;em>even available&lt;/em>, and what its shelfmark is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is the potential to make the process of recommending, finding, borrowing and even commenting on the value and relevance of a particular library resource more seamless by linking-up the library website and learn.gold site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>study tools</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/study-tools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 22:32:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/study-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve invested a lot of time in researching and testing tools to support my studies. i wanted to to break away from so-called &amp;lsquo;productivity tools&amp;rsquo;, as in all my years of using software like Visio, Word, Outlook, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been productive: too much of my time and effort has been wasted in taming the application, or repeated manually generating my desired formatting - perhaps counter-productivity tools would be more accurate.&lt;/p>
