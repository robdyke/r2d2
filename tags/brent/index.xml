He also voted with the Govt for the euphemistic motion cited above.
What we will see over the coming weeks is a flood of photo opportunities in front of Post Offices&amp;hellip; All you need to remember is that Dawn and Barry vote with the Govt on &amp;lsquo;national issues&amp;rsquo; then campaign against the Govt on &amp;lsquo;local issues&amp;rsquo;, even when they are the same issue.</description></item><item><title>Dollis Hill House</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/19/dollis-hill-house/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2008 20:40:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/02/19/dollis-hill-house/</guid><description>I spend a lot of time in Gladstone Park and I&amp;rsquo;ve recently taken an interest in the state of Dollis Hill House. I think that the kindest word to describe the building is &amp;lsquo;wreak&amp;rsquo;. There are plans (there are always plans) to restore the house from the Dollis Hill House Trust in partnership with Training For Life. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what they are in detail&amp;hellip; but the appear to involve getting a whole bunch of money together to renovate the building into a venue of some kind - better than flats&amp;hellip; no worse than demolition.</description></item><item><title>Cricklewood Library - NOT under threat!</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library-not-under-threat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2007 23:01:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library-not-under-threat/</guid><description>Cllr Chris Leaman writes
&amp;ldquo;The rumour and subsequent petition started after a report which recommended library closures was released into the public domain. This report was based on a strategy to libraries that was agreed under the previous Labour administration.
The current executive have rejected this plan and asked for a new strategy to be written. I understand that the new strategy will not recommend library closures. The new draft library strategy should be published in the next few weeks.</description></item><item><title>Cricklewood Library</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2007 08:46:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</guid><description>I have heard rumors locally about the closure of Cricklewood library and todaysigned a petition, organised by Friends of Cricklewood Library to keep it open.
I&amp;rsquo;ve emailed Brent Council and the Lib Dem Councillors to try and discover more truth or otherwise about this rumor.</description></item><item><title>Feeling blue?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/02/15/feeling-blue/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2005 03:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/02/15/feeling-blue/</guid><description>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure who the campaign material that recently popped through my front door belonged to.

She is pictured with staff from the New Deal Communities group announcing further measures to curb anti-social behavior in South Kilburn. Residents of estates in South Kilburn are being urged to report drug-dealing to Crimestoppers and Crime Concern to reduce the high drug crime rate of the area.
There are two letters relating to an award presented by Sarah reported in the October 20th edition of the paper.</description></item><item><title>Compare and contrast</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/29/compare-and-contrast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2004 01:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/29/compare-and-contrast/</guid><description>Last week, in a show of openness prior to the commencement of the &amp;lsquo;Freedom of Information Act&amp;rsquo; next year, MPs released the details of their expenses for public review. In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Kilburn Times, part of the Archant London Group of newspapers, Kristina Pedersen reports on the disclosure.
The paper has published tables comparing the MPs that serve the constituencies that their paper is published in: - Tony McNulty (Harrow East), Paul Boateng (Brent South), Barry Gardiner (Brent North), Gareth Thomas (Harrow West), Mark Field (Cities of London &amp;amp; Westminster), Karen Buck (Regent&amp;rsquo;s Park &amp;amp; Kensington North), Clive Soley (Ealing, Acton &amp;amp; Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Bush), Glenda Jackson (Hampstead &amp;amp; Highgate), Iain Coleman (Putney), Sarah Teather (Brent East) and Michael Portillo (Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea).</description></item><item><title>MP’s expenses</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/29/mps-expenses/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2004 01:00:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/29/mps-expenses/</guid><description>I wrote the post below last weekend - but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to post it until today. Sorry.
I was sure I was going to have something to say on this topic after I saw the manner which the placater of the commuting masses &amp;lsquo;Metro&amp;rsquo; covered the story: &amp;ldquo;UK pay is dwarfed by MP&amp;rsquo;s expenses&amp;rdquo; (Frontpage, Fri 22 Oct). Here we have an example of the media creating a frenzy.</description></item><item><title>Fridge Update</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/06/fridge-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2004 14:57:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/10/06/fridge-update/</guid><description>Brevity is clarity.

They acknowledge my request and the Councils contractors will be along to remove the items &amp;ldquo;over the next few days&amp;rdquo;.
Not got a specific answer to the question of WHY do I have to print and return this online request. L was saying to me that &amp;lsquo;it never used to be this obfuscated&amp;rsquo; and that a single phone call would have sufficied in the past.</description></item><item><title>My Douglas Adams Fridge</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/09/24/my-douglas-adams-fridge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2004 14:23:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/09/24/my-douglas-adams-fridge/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ll remember Sarah&amp;rsquo;s campaign - it is highly memorable after all! Without a hit of sarcasam: when I am walking about Brent and I see the spoil that is illegal fly-tipping I think &amp;lsquo;thats a grot spot that is&amp;rsquo;.
Well. I recently disposed the aging 1980s 75/25 Fridge/Ice Box monster that lurked in the corner of my kitchen and took delivery of two purring sleek shinning white replacements. So now I have the need for a &amp;lsquo;Special Collection&amp;rsquo; from Brent&amp;rsquo;s Street Care Team.</description></item><item><title>Sarah wants to know your views</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/11/sarah-wants-to-know-your-views/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2004 16:17:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/11/sarah-wants-to-know-your-views/</guid><description>On Friday 6th August, Sarah announced that she was to conduct her own &amp;lsquo;Big Conversation&amp;rsquo; consultation with the residents of Brent East.
&amp;ldquo;Too many politicians think they know what&amp;rsquo;s best, without taking the time to listen to local people. I hope that Brent residents take the time to fill in the survey so that I can take up their issues both with the local Council as well as taking them up in Parliament.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning Up Brent</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/cleaning-up-brent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2004 12:05:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/cleaning-up-brent/</guid><description>I am pleased to see Sarah continuing to take action on the street furniture left behind following the privatisation and deregulation the telecoms industry.
Announcing her actions, Sarah said:
&amp;ldquo;Derelict phone boxes are an eyesore in Brent. Local residents are sick and tired of seeing them being used as rubbish bins, fly-poster sites and public toilets. I hope that local people show their frustration at these monstrosities by signing my petition.</description></item><item><title>Safer Neighbourhoods</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/safer-neighbourhoods/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2004 11:48:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/safer-neighbourhoods/</guid><description>On Monday, Sarah attended the launch of the Metropolitian Police Safer Neighbourhoods initiative in Kilburn.
First launched for the Stonebridge Estate in April this year, the program aims to provide new teams of uniformed officers working within communities to tackle quality-of-life issues and anti-social behaviour crimes.
Sarah commented that it was community policing that local people wanted. &amp;ldquo;Not only do they want more police on the streets, they want police officers who they know and trust.</description></item></channel></rss>
