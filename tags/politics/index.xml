A new Hansard Society report, sponsored by Microsoft, MPs Online: Connecting with Constituents, reveals that MPs are using the internet primarily to inform their constituents rather than engage with them. The most widely used digital media are those which are mainly passive in nature, such as website. Interactive forms of media which could be used by MPs to develop a two-way dialogue with their constituents, such as blogs and social networking, are used less commonly.</description></item><item><title>The online campaign; an event by Hansard</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/the-online-campaign-an-event-by-hansard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2009 09:09:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/the-online-campaign-an-event-by-hansard/</guid><description>Just digging around the Hansard Society website for a copy of the report on MPs online, published by the e-democracy unit and I found the blurb for this event, The Online Campaign, in late March.
The use of online strategies is becoming increasingly important, encouraging grass-roots activism and enabling mass mobilisation. But there is no guarantee that the cooption of online strategies will guarantee electoral success or promote healthy dialogue between politicians and citizens.</description></item><item><title>MPs Online - Hansard Society publication</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/mps-online-hansard-society-publication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2009 09:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/mps-online-hansard-society-publication/</guid><description>Just been listening to the Toady programme on R4 and heard in the news report at 8am that the Hansard Society had published a report on MPs online. According to the Societies' website, this &amp;ldquo;research attempts to understand how MPs themselves feel the internet affects the way that they work and communicate with their constituents. The research includes a survey of MPs and a focus group of MPs and their office staff.</description></item><item><title>recently reading "The Liberty of the Networked" at oD</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/18/recently-reading-the-liberty-of-the-networked-at-od/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2009 15:59:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/18/recently-reading-the-liberty-of-the-networked-at-od/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been following Tony Curzon-Price&amp;rsquo;s essay The Liberty of the Networked (and part 2 and part 3) published over at the excellent openDemocracy.net to coincide in with The Convention on Modern Liberty to be held in London and across the UK on February 28th.

If democracy is to be the rule of the the people, asking &amp;lsquo;how close is local?&amp;rsquo; is asking the perennial question of democracy: which people? Knowing who is governed is as important as knowing that those people govern themselves.
Our democracy is stratified like a company organisational chart. A simplistic drawing would show Government at the top and parish councils at the bottom and a myriad of other organisations with decision-marking powers over any number of areas of our daily lives arranged on the intervening levels.</description></item><item><title>Show Us a Better Way and Free Our Bills</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/11/13/show-us-a-better-way-and-free-our-bills/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2008 13:21:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/11/13/show-us-a-better-way-and-free-our-bills/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy fortnight for open-information projects and campaigns. Widely announced and re-announced were the winners of the Show Us A Better Way (SUABW) competition, sponsored by the Government, which sought new solutions to perhaps unknown problems. SUABW asked people what web-based tools they would build from public data-sources that would improve the way public information is shared and presented.
The winners are:

Is it the speculative &amp;lsquo;unregulated&amp;rsquo; oil trading that William Pfaff, &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/23/opinion/edpfaff.php" title="International Herald Tribune">writing in the IHT&lt;/a>, criticises? Certainly the black magic of contract trading is a factor, a parasite on the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; market for the commodity. According to the BBC, OPEC has so far blamed price rises on speculators and says there is no shortage of oil. Likewise, Pfaff considers the present situation with rising prices dissimilar to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="Wikipedia entry">1973 oil crisis&lt;/a>, when OPEC announced that they would no longer supply oil to nations that supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paul Krugman, &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/19/opinion/edkrugman.php" title="International Herald Tribune">also in the IHT&lt;/a>, is somewhat naive if he thinks that we are entering merely an &lt;strong>era&lt;/strong> of scarce, expensive oil. This is more than an era. The buried sunlight that we like to burn is running out. Scarcity is the true reality. It&amp;rsquo;s more than Half Gone. Not only is the raw material that we are critically addicted to becoming more expensive as it becomes increasingly scarce, feeding our addiction in consuming oil is one of the major causes of global warming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UKCOD, whatdotheyknow and other web projects for shaking up democracy</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/25/ukcod-whatdotheyknow-and-other-web-project-for-shaking-up-democracy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2008 22:13:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/03/25/ukcod-whatdotheyknow-and-other-web-project-for-shaking-up-democracy/</guid><description>UK Citizens Online Democracy&amp;rsquo;s (UKCOD) main activity is running the mySocietyproject, building websites which &amp;ldquo;give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives.&amp;rdquo;
