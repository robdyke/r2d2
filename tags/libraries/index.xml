&amp;ldquo;The rumour and subsequent petition started after a report which recommended library closures was released into the public domain. This report was based on a strategy to libraries that was agreed under the previous Labour administration.
The current executive have rejected this plan and asked for a new strategy to be written. I understand that the new strategy will not recommend library closures. The new draft library strategy should be published in the next few weeks.</description></item><item><title>Cricklewood Library</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2007 08:46:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/09/05/cricklewood-library/</guid><description>I have heard rumors locally about the closure of Cricklewood library and today signed a petition, organised by Friends of Cricklewood Library to keep it open.
I&amp;rsquo;ve emailed Brent Council and the Lib Dem Councillors to try and discover more truth or otherwise about this rumor.</description></item></channel></rss>
