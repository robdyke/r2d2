It helps catch parties or candidates who are breaking electoral law - 2 parties have been reported to the authorities based on leaflets uploaded to TheStraightChoice.</description></item><item><title>Brent Central - track the candidates</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/23/brent-central-track-the-candidates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 23:25:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/23/brent-central-track-the-candidates/</guid><description>Democracy Club website helps us to hold candidates to account, and stimulate public engagement in the campaigns for local and national elections.

Labour Minister Dawn Butler has issued a legal apology to Sarah Teather for calling her a hypocrite over MPs’ expenses. Butler made the accusation while the running of Sarah Teather’s office was under investigation. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner later dropped the investigation because there were no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by Ms Teather.
This issue came up at the MapRA Hustings on Monday night.</description></item><item><title>photos from the MapRA hustings last night.</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/20/photos-from-the-mapra-hustings-last-night/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 19:35:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/20/photos-from-the-mapra-hustings-last-night/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bums on seats&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>

The theme of this newsletter is rubbish. Brent Labour argue that the charge made by the council for bulky refuse collection has lead to an increase in fly-tipping in Brent and pledge to &amp;lsquo;dump&amp;rsquo; the £25 charge if elected. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t inducement enough for you, they claim that cuts, CUTS!, will reduce the frequency of rubbish collection.
The main flytipping problem in Brent is caused by unscrupulous builder, dumping domestic building waste.</description></item><item><title>MP Sarah Cleared</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 18:29:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A letter of complaint against Sarah Teather was sent to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, supposedly from a man at an address in Brent.

Well that&amp;rsquo;s me on both counts.</description></item><item><title>Parking tickets in Brent and the FoI Act</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/21/parking-tickets-in-brent-and-the-foi-act/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2006 05:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/21/parking-tickets-in-brent-and-the-foi-act/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shahrar Ali, a Green Party candidate at both this years local and last years national elections, sent me an email yesterday on a topic important to car-owners - Penalty Charge Notices, or, rather, f&amp;rsquo;ing-tickets, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of us refer to them. Shahrar told me about meeting Brent residents while campaigning during the local elections and a common gripe that came up - being issued with a ticket on a public holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He writes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Trouble is, &amp;ldquo;Restrictions apply on Bank Holidays&amp;rdquo; signage is to be found only on some of the posts as one enters the zone. But most people, reasonably in my view, take their cue from the signage in the bays - which without any explicit indication to the contrary they will assume does not apply on public holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent can&amp;rsquo;t have it both ways. Had the assumption not been justified there would hardly be a need for the additional signage. The trouble is these signs are not fit for purpose, ie. noticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s at issue? Nobody likes to get a fine at the best of times, but the suspicion is that signage has been erected to maximise the chances of catching people out and making a quick buck. That&amp;rsquo;s dishonest and only fuels resentment towards local government - increasing cynicsm and eroding trust in public or democratic institutions, moreover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>quick hello</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/08/08/quick-hello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2006 10:22:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/08/08/quick-hello/</guid><description>I just wanted to say a quick hello to the frequent visitors out there (you know who you are).

&lt;p>QUEEN&amp;rsquo;S PARK TOWERBLOCK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people have been asking me about the Council&amp;rsquo;s plan to put a 26-storey towerblock on the car park next to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Station. The Council is not prepared to have an open public consultation about the proposal. My view is that the people who elected me as their councillor deserve to be informed about the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Council was in extensive pre-application talks with the proposed developer, Genesis, from at least the middle of 2004. In April 2005, the Council amended the planning guidance relating to the site to allow for a building of up to 20 storeys paving the way for Genesis&amp;rsquo;s planning application for a set of twin 26-storey towerblocks. The Council persuaded them to withdraw it in September 2005 due to the unexpected level of public opposition to the proposal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>where did the logo go?

In the tense 10 minutes that the candidates stood with the returning officer and inspected the doubtful ballot papers I was sharing my impressions of the campaign with Paul Keilthy from Archant Media Group.</description></item><item><title>Any Answers?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/08/any-answers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2005 10:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/08/any-answers/</guid><description>Germaine Greer has some advice for newly elected politicians - don&amp;rsquo;t wear little red suits.

From the Lib Dem website election news ticker:

I&amp;rsquo;ve still got the &amp;lsquo;wild eyes&amp;rsquo; I had yesterday, although that&amp;rsquo;s now from lack of sleep. This politics junkie had quite an Election Day.

Tally mark after tally mark after tally mark. From what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing as I tally out the ballots as they come out of the box for the collate before the count, it really is neck and neck.
For every one vote the Greens receive, the Conservatives are getting seven, the Liberal Democrats 45 and Labour 47 = 100 votes.

Our policies are based on common sense.</description></item><item><title>Lack of campaign materials - Labour</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/lack-of-campaign-materials-labour/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2005 12:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/lack-of-campaign-materials-labour/</guid><description>On the back of the Mapesbury Labour News distributed by Yasmin at the MapRA Annual General Meeting there is a list of ways to contact Yasmin: By phone: 020 8969 4550, By email: info@yasminqureshi.co.uk, By writting to: 102 Liddell Gardens, Kensal Rise, NW10 3QE.

Having been very impressed by the collective action that MapRA have motived in their community around the Mapesbury Dell project and the purchase of old-fashioned, sorry, &amp;lsquo;heritage&amp;rsquo; street lights for some of the streets, I thought that a Community Wireless Broadband Network would have been something that the residents of Mapesbury may have been interested in working to acheive.</description></item><item><title>Campaign Materials - Green Party</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/campaign-materials-greens/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2005 10:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/23/campaign-materials-greens/</guid><description>I received the Green Party Election Communication for Brent East earlier this week.

I had expected to see Sarah Teather there: She was there last year, speaking on some of the activities that she, as the local MP, had beeen working on with MapRA and other people from the neighbouorhood.</description></item><item><title>C4.com on Brent East</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/c4com-on-brent-east/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2005 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/c4com-on-brent-east/</guid><description>From Channel 4.com Election 2005 site.
&amp;lsquo;Labour has placed its hopes on lawyer Yasmin Qureishi, who is openly anti-war in her selection process. But like many Labour candidates in what was Labour&amp;rsquo;s urban core support she is going even further to regain disgruntled voters by opposing the policies of the prime minister.
She told Channel 4 news: “I’m one of those people who has their own mind, their own independent mind, and I make my own decisions.</description></item><item><title>Linkup for George 'Rainbow' Weiss</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/linkup-for-george-rainbow-weiss/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2005 09:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/21/linkup-for-george-rainbow-weiss/</guid><description>Thanks to a reader, here are some links for the Vote For Yourself Dream Ticket Party and George &amp;lsquo;Rainbox&amp;rsquo; Weiss.

You can read the full interview here. What interested me was Sarah&amp;rsquo;s answer to this final question: How will you convince Brent voters to give you another term as MP?
&amp;ldquo;I am going to have to work extremely hard over the next two years because many people voted for me partly on a protest. Some people voted for me because our policies but some people also voted against Tony Blair and I am going to need to persuade those people that there are positive reasons for voting for me.</description></item><item><title>Candidate List Announced</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/20/candidate-list-announced/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2005 08:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/04/20/candidate-list-announced/</guid><description>The candidates in the Brent East constituency have been announced.
