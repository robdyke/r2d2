The text has provoked a critical examination of my own politics, bringing about a new consciousness of subject and sovereignty, of agency in a hyperglobalised world and of resistance to global capital. To a greater or lesser degree I do support Hardt and Negri’s contention that we now live in the age of Empire.</description></item><item><title>To what extent do social, p2p or participatory financial models democratise capital?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/ba-politics/new-radical-politicial-economy/essay/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 00:12:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/ba-politics/new-radical-politicial-economy/essay/</guid><description>“What matters in the world is money, machines and people, in that order.

The long established savings and loan institutions are criticised at every point, from the financial models that they operate down to their de-personalised, off-shore call-centres. My argument in this paper is that banking services are anti-social, hierarchical and intensely private. These traditional banking services are, I contend, inherently undemocratic, even anti-democratic at the extremes.</description></item><item><title>And another thing...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2018/03/04/and-another-thing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2018/03/04/and-another-thing/</guid><description>And another thing&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>NHoS Closedown - the final straw</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2018/01/17/the-final-straw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2018/01/17/the-final-straw/</guid><description>Sorry (and of course thanks) to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s helped out with the NHSbuntu Linux project and it&amp;rsquo;s revamped version NHoS but I think we&amp;rsquo;ve finally reached a point where we&amp;rsquo;ve had enough.

To create our distribution we use tools from the Ubuntu ecosystem to package our customisations and build the download images. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the techniques and tools we use for this.
Customisations Our core customisations are handled using a template from the ubuntu-default-settings package. This template allows us to easily set defaults for the look and feel of the desktop as well as tailoring the packages included in the installation.</description></item><item><title>Apperta Foundation supports NHSbuntu development</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-supports-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/19/apperta-supports-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very excited to be able to announce that the Apperta Foundation, (which was formerly the NHS England Open Source Programme) has agreed to provide NHSbuntu with initial support funding of £40k, in order to facilitate the initial few work packages required for NHSbuntu&amp;rsquo;s next few steps.
Details of the work packages will be published shortly, and we are of course open to community suggestions for future work packages. Initially we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on setting up good tooling for reproducible automated builds of NHSbuntu, and adding some new features.</description></item><item><title>NHS urged to consider Microsoft alternatives following cyber attacks</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/digitalhealth-net/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/17/digitalhealth-net/</guid><description>Jon Hoeksma interviewed us about NHSbuntu for Digital Health.
In the wake of Friday’s international cyber attacks, which caused widespread disruption across NHS organisations, a small team of developers is recommending the health service reduce its reliance on Microsoft.
The NHS almost exclusively uses Microsoft operating systems, some of which – like Windows XP – are no longer officially supported.
To demonstrate that there is a licence-free alternative, GP Marcus Baw and technologist Rob Dyke have adapted the open source Linux-based Ubuntu operating system specifically for the NHS.</description></item><item><title>JoinUp Open source observatory report on NHSbuntu</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/osor-eu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/05/10/osor-eu/</guid><description>Gijs Hillenius wrote about NHSbuntu for the Open Source Observatory.
A group of British IT health care specialists have tailored the Ubuntu Linux distribution for use by the UK’s national health service (NHS) on its workstations. The alpha version of NHSbuntu was unveiled at the South West CIO Forum on 27 April.
The advantages of NHSbuntu over proprietary PC operating systems include security, speed, costs and freedom. Using NHSbuntu will also enable NHS organisations to run up-to-date versions of browsers, creating an environment in which innovation can flourish, the developers say.</description></item><item><title>SxSW CIO &amp; CCIO Show and Tell</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-show-and-tell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/04/26/sxsw-show-and-tell/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Why NHSbuntu?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/</guid><description>Look.

In this post I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the role of governance and community around open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following the Safer Hospitals, Safer Wards Technology Fund announced in June of this year, &lt;a href="http://garymcallisteronline.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/open-source-in-nhs.html">Gary McAllister posted a comment piece&lt;/a> which neatly summarises key criteria of open source which I paraphrase here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The code should be freely available online, well-documented and accessible. It should be evident from the code repository that regular commits are made to the project from multiple sources, demonstrating that the code-base is active.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The licensing for the code should utilise an &amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; license. Examples of licenses which meet the Open Source Initiative definition of open source can be seen here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A project should have corporate investment and a viable service provider clearly backing the product. This may sound counter intuitive but in order for an Open solution to be viable long-term it needs backing from a corporate entity. Without corporate backing the solution is &amp;ldquo;unsupported&amp;rdquo; and there is little evidence to ensure continued development. You could end up with a stale loaf of bread.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In a short series of blogs I&amp;rsquo;m planning to post I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at these announcements and the reaction from a few different perspectives.

&lt;p>This last week I was at EHI Live with HANDI and Tactix4. HANDI were producing one of the streams at this exhibition &amp;lsquo;The HANDI Health Apps Conference&amp;rsquo;. HANDI Health Apps is the first national conference dedicated to health &amp;amp; social care apps and lightweight digital tools to take place in the UK.  It was a “must attend” event for app developers, health and care professionals, managers and commissioners who are seeking to understand how this new generation of digital tools can support the delivery of efficient, patient centred care. The conference included the HANDI-App Village located right in the centre of the EHI Live Exhibition providing a unique platform where health and care app developers can showcase their products without getting lost amongst the large stands of the major IT vendors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we had a village pub, serving real beer and excellent pork scratchings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it was a good idea to &amp;lsquo;live code&amp;rsquo; an app. In hind sight it was a good idea to &amp;lsquo;live code&amp;rsquo; an app and, except for the failure of the internet link, it would have worked well. Thankfully, as a child of Blue Peter, I had an app that I had made earlier prepared and ready installed on my device. With this APK file I was able to demo an app that scanned a barcode containing a URL and launch a browser. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/WWScan-QR.apk">APK&lt;/a> and here is the &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/EhiLive.png">QR code&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>dissecting a major Govt IT project to deliver a political objective</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2013/11/05/dissecting-a-major-govt-it-project-to-deliver-a-political-objective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 17:49:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2013/11/05/dissecting-a-major-govt-it-project-to-deliver-a-political-objective/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some notes taken on observing people the other side of the pond dissecting a major Govt IT project to deliver a political objective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Would this project have benefited from &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-16/open-source-everything-the-moral-of-the-healthcare-dot-gov-debacle">Opensorcery&lt;/a>? If PPACA wasn&amp;rsquo;t communist enough! Writing in Bloomberg Businessweek, Paul Ford explains that the debacle known as &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">healthcare.gov&lt;/a> makes clear that it is time for government to change the way it delivers IT: embrace the open source approach to software development that has revolutionized the technology industry. Well, openness worked before for Obama e.g. with the &lt;a href="https://www.itdashboard.gov/">IT spending dashboard&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/it-dashboard/">code here&lt;/a>) but that was in the first years of the first term. You can do &lt;strong>anything&lt;/strong> in that period of a presidency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the Congressional hearing (which makes our &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubacc/294/29402.htm">PAC look rather tame on NPfIT&lt;/a>) as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/obamacare-website-testify-congress-live">reported by Grauniad&lt;/a> two lessons stand out for me. One technical, the other political.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a technical perspective the importance of proving an end-to-end test FIRST and n&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuzyKhimm/statuses/393392886965747712">ot two weeks prior to a go-live&lt;/a> is crucial. This is the approach we are taking with Wardware and the other projects we are working on. Can we pass a simple message through the components of the stack? No. Fix it. And now? Yes. Great! Build on and test for regressions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the special category of the awards that is, of course, chosen by the readers of EHI</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2013/10/13/the-special-category-of-the-awards-that-is-of-course-chosen-by-the-readers-of-ehi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 22:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2013/10/13/the-special-category-of-the-awards-that-is-of-course-chosen-by-the-readers-of-ehi/</guid><description>So, this years Healthcare IT Champion of the Year, the special category of the awards that is chosen by the readers of EHI, was announced as Kemi Adenubi, the GPSoC programme director for the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

We thought that as online appointment booking and using video for clinical consultations are so QIPPing hot right now with the NHS Commissioning Board and the Department of Health Tech Office falling over themselves to encourage the use of Skype for Doctor/Patient consultations and being loudly evangelical about appointment booking we ought to hack something for that.</description></item><item><title>Digidoc 2012</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/2/digidoc-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 10:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/2/digidoc-2012/</guid><description>&amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;photonic-flickr-image photonic-flickr-photo photonic-pad-photos&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a class='launch-gallery-fancybox fancybox' rel='lightbox-photonic-flickr-stream-1' href=&amp;quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8485/8246080999_384d950a17_z.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;#039;https://www.flickr.com/photos/90867769@N08/8246080999&amp;amp;#039; &amp;gt;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8485/8246080999_384d950a17_s.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;photonic-flickr-image photonic-flickr-photo photonic-pad-photos&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a class='launch-gallery-fancybox fancybox' rel='lightbox-photonic-flickr-stream-1' href=&amp;quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8490/8247148216_a818883076_z.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;#039;https://www.flickr.com/photos/90867769@N08/8247148216&amp;amp;#039; &amp;gt;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8490/8247148216_a818883076_s.jpg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;photonic-flickr-image photonic-flickr-photo photonic-pad-photos&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a class='launch-gallery-fancybox fancybox' rel='lightbox-photonic-flickr-stream-1' href=&amp;quot;https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8208/8247148334_3917262395_z.jpg&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;#039;https://www.flickr.com/photos/90867769@N08/8247148334&amp;amp;#039; &amp;gt;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt=&amp;quot;Afternoon Session - App Ideas Factories&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://farm9.</description></item><item><title>Talking HANDI and opensource</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/31/talking-handi-and-opensource/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 10:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/31/talking-handi-and-opensource/</guid><description>A couple of video interviews with me made with Pete Cogle from Inside Talking.</description></item><item><title>Tactix4 with ITK ISCF award with Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/16/tactix4-with-itk-iscf-award-with-luton-and-dunstable-nhs-trust/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 18:11:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/12/16/tactix4-with-itk-iscf-award-with-luton-and-dunstable-nhs-trust/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased that my company &lt;a href="http://www.tactix4.com/">Tactix4&lt;/a> has won two awards from The &lt;a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/sharing-challenge-funding/">Information Sharing Challenge Fund&lt;/a>, a Department of Health initiative funding ideas that change the way information is used and shared between different organisations.&lt;/p>

We worked on a project called &lt;a href="http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/AsKit">AsKiT&lt;/a> which came second. It was great to collaborate with others from NHS organisations to create problem solving code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**The Problem: **All throughout the NHS there are a myriad of forms, questionnaires and assessments that need to be done, and the vast majority of them are done on paper, with the results stored in a folder in a cabinet or later scanned in and saved as a pdf file. Neither of these solutions allows ready access to the information in a digital form, and does not provide any of the benefits of digital capture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution:&lt;/strong> By creating a general-purpose question asking android app we have removed the need for the paper part of the process, now the questions are displayed on the screen and the results are captured digitally. It is no longer possible to write something that is illegible, or answers a numerical question with letters, or forget to answer certain questions. The results are then sent securely to the server where they are stored and can be forwarded directly to the appropriate system for further use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A few notes on the enthusiasm around healthcare IT</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/07/06/a-few-notes-on-the-enthusiasm-around-healthcare-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2012 12:55:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/07/06/a-few-notes-on-the-enthusiasm-around-healthcare-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a renewed vigor in healthcare IT.

&lt;p>The winning development, called ‘Patient List’, aimed to improve the handover of patients and replace the traditional task-list methods usually employed by doctors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Patient List problem is felt by every junior doctor in the NHS, but it was formally raised by Wai Keong Wong in a blog post titled &lt;a href="http://blog.openhealthcare.org.uk/?p=66">&amp;ldquo;Give every doctor an extra 30mins/day with patients&lt;/a> by solving the &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nhshackday/8JAwPEQbJbk/discussion">‘Patient List’ problem&lt;/a>&amp;quot;. In summary, a system is needed to save junior doctors from error-prone manual daily work compiling lists of patients and their treatments for their daily rounds. Furthermore, the system should include task lists for each patient and a way to manage transfer of tasks between shifts and departments so that nothing gets forgotten during handover.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A problem with mHealth apps....</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/23/a-problem-with-mhealth-apps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2012 10:06:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/23/a-problem-with-mhealth-apps/</guid><description>&lt;p>From a thread on the handihealth discussion group.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The general thrust of the article is that current crop of popular mHealth reflect the needs and desires of particular socio-economic groups: white, suburban, materially secure, educated technologists creating apps that compliment the gym going, lifestyle jogging hipsters. Apps become the technological expressions of the &amp;lsquo;quantified self&amp;rsquo; of the developers - &amp;ldquo;Homogenous teams of innovators make products for people just like them. And that&amp;rsquo;s a problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps this &amp;lsquo;quantified self&amp;rsquo; analysis misses for the point, for not just the old and cynical but for the vast majority of the population : &amp;ldquo;After all, we build what we know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NHS branding for healthcare apps</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/19/nhs-branding-for-healthcare-apps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2012 10:36:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/19/nhs-branding-for-healthcare-apps/</guid><description>A single corporate identity for the NHS was introduced in 1999. This replaced the 600 or so logos within the NHS, all competing with each other for the public’s attention. This competition made it difficult for people to distinguish NHS services and communications from those of commercial companies or charities. The single NHS identity was created to address these issues of identity and to improve recognition and accountability.
There are guidelines for print, web and powerpoint presentations; colours and branding for each of the organisation types, from dentists to foundation hospitals.</description></item><item><title>Here's HANDI Health</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/05/heres-handi-health/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2012 16:18:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2012/03/05/heres-handi-health/</guid><description>&lt;p>This month I co-founded &lt;a href="http://www.handihealth.net/about-2">HANDI, a new not-for-profit venture. - The Healthcare App Network for Development and Innovation&lt;/a> with a few others in the healthcare sector.&lt;/p>

Rather than write anything more (that you won&amp;rsquo;t read) about dotgotlabs, here is a &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/21720640">video produced to explain the project&lt;/a> &amp;hellip; including me and others with great faces for radio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With interests in open source, open standards and interoperability and with experience in and around the NHS, I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to many solutions posted in the Healthcare challenge.  I&amp;rsquo;ve commented on the &lt;a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/interop/making">interoperability&lt;/a> challenges facing &amp;lsquo;Solutions&amp;rsquo; such as &amp;lsquo;Give Patients Access to Data&amp;rsquo; (a challenge involving &lt;a href="http://www.patientopinion.org.uk/">Patient Opinion&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.mydex.org">MyDex&lt;/a>, see previous post on &lt;a href="http://www.robdyke.com/noc/2011/03/24/brent-council-to-allow-residents-to-manage-their-personal-data/">Brent Council opening up resident data access&lt;/a>) and on the use of social media in healthcare solutions &amp;hellip; and the &lt;a href="http://mmt.me.uk/blog/2010/11/21/nhs-and-tracking/">privacy implications&lt;/a> there in&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing heavily to a solution posted by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/timknight">Tim Knight&lt;/a> which proposed greater use of open source practices in the NHS - provisionally titled &lt;a href="https://dotgovlabs.direct.gov.uk/Page/ViewIdea?ideaid=1293">Open Me Project&lt;/a> (login req; email me for invitation).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of the solution is to provide a framework and supporting tools for the collaborative development of open source solutions for NHS organisations and commercial healthcare providers.

A Lib/Lab coalition under AV would have a 60 seat majority, with a Lib/Con group a majority of 98.</description></item><item><title>Would Brent Central Lib Dems punish Sarah Teather for Lib/Con pact?</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/10/would-brent-central-lib-dems-punish-sarah-teather-for-libcon-pact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2010 12:22:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/05/10/would-brent-central-lib-dems-punish-sarah-teather-for-libcon-pact/</guid><description>Brent Central is close.

Labour Minister Dawn Butler has issued a legal apology to Sarah Teather for calling her a hypocrite over MPs’ expenses. Butler made the accusation while the running of Sarah Teather’s office was under investigation. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner later dropped the investigation because there were no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by Ms Teather.

The theme of this newsletter is rubbish. Brent Labour argue that the charge made by the council for bulky refuse collection has lead to an increase in fly-tipping in Brent and pledge to &amp;lsquo;dump&amp;rsquo; the £25 charge if elected. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t inducement enough for you, they claim that cuts, CUTS!, will reduce the frequency of rubbish collection.
The main flytipping problem in Brent is caused by unscrupulous builder, dumping domestic building waste.</description></item><item><title>MP Sarah Cleared</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 18:29:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2010/04/01/mp-sarah-cleared/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A letter of complaint against Sarah Teather was sent to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, supposedly from a man at an address in Brent.

A new Hansard Society report, sponsored by Microsoft, MPs Online: Connecting with Constituents, reveals that MPs are using the internet primarily to inform their constituents rather than engage with them. The most widely used digital media are those which are mainly passive in nature, such as website. Interactive forms of media which could be used by MPs to develop a two-way dialogue with their constituents, such as blogs and social networking, are used less commonly.</description></item><item><title>The online campaign; an event by Hansard</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/the-online-campaign-an-event-by-hansard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2009 09:09:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2009/02/24/the-online-campaign-an-event-by-hansard/</guid><description>Just digging around the Hansard Society website for a copy of the report on MPs online, published by the e-democracy unit and I found the blurb for this event, The Online Campaign, in late March.

Knowing who is governed is as important as knowing that those people govern themselves.

That this House believes it has a duty to publish Bills in such a fashion that they can be accessed as easily and as early as possible by the public; notes that the non-partisan Free Our Bills campaign is urging the House to publish bill texts in a new electronic format to improve accessibility and public scrutiny of legislation; further notes that the changes requested would have no impact on the content of Bills, nor upon the process by which they are currently made; considers that the new format could be delivered cheaply and quickly; acknowledges that the Leader of the House&amp;rsquo;s office did not accept a prior request for new formatting from mySociety, nor provide an explanation of why the changes could be made; and calls on the Leader of House to ask House of Commons Clerks to work with Free Our Bills campaign staff to commence publication of Bills in the new format.</description></item><item><title>More booze on the Broadway - respond now!</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/11/04/more-booze-on-the-broadway-respond-now/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2008 14:50:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/11/04/more-booze-on-the-broadway-respond-now/</guid><description>The NW2 residents association is alerting local residents to an application for a 24h license for the sale of alcohol by a new business opening on the broadway.

Is it the speculative &amp;lsquo;unregulated&amp;rsquo; oil trading that William Pfaff, &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/23/opinion/edpfaff.php" title="International Herald Tribune">writing in the IHT&lt;/a>, criticises? Certainly the black magic of contract trading is a factor, a parasite on the &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; market for the commodity. According to the BBC, OPEC has so far blamed price rises on speculators and says there is no shortage of oil. Likewise, Pfaff considers the present situation with rising prices dissimilar to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="Wikipedia entry">1973 oil crisis&lt;/a>, when OPEC announced that they would no longer supply oil to nations that supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paul Krugman, &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/19/opinion/edkrugman.php" title="International Herald Tribune">also in the IHT&lt;/a>, is somewhat naive if he thinks that we are entering merely an &lt;strong>era&lt;/strong> of scarce, expensive oil. This is more than an era. The buried sunlight that we like to burn is running out. Scarcity is the true reality. It&amp;rsquo;s more than Half Gone. Not only is the raw material that we are critically addicted to becoming more expensive as it becomes increasingly scarce, feeding our addiction in consuming oil is one of the major causes of global warming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>dissertation project - submitted and now online</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/21/dissertation-project-submitted-and-now-online/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2008 22:54:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/21/dissertation-project-submitted-and-now-online/</guid><description>Hacking the Networked Society.
Abstract: The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. In this paper, I show how philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have engendered new forms of socio-political consumption and new political economies of meaning. My emphasis on the interplay between the local and the global/structure and agency, shows new ways of &amp;lsquo;thinking&amp;rsquo; the cosmopolitan, sedimented in the interconnected networks of the technical age.</description></item><item><title>self-publishing of recent essays</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/20/self-publishing-of-recent-essays/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 16:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2008/05/20/self-publishing-of-recent-essays/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve converted some of my recent papers into web pages for easy reading online.

&lt;p>There are many ways of rigging an election and, with increased abstraction and dispersal of the act of voting, influencing the outcome of ballots gets easier and easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s just think for a moment what takes place when a student votes. First of all, the student needs to be co-present with the ballot! This is a given and the only part of the process that can not be virtualised. The student presents some ID before being given a ballot paper. The ballot is privately completed and cast into the ballot box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Goldsmiths College Students Election e-Voting was extremely vulnerable to exploitation by someone with malicious intent. The e-voting mechanism virtualised the ballot paper instead of virtualising the whole process. Anyone visiting the goldsmithsstudents.com website was able to download a Microsoft Word file. This file used a macro to capture the input of the user; in this case the ranking of the preference of candidates. A student was expected to complete the form, save it, then send the file as an attachment from their college email account to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="mailto:su@gold.ac.uk">su@gold.ac.uk&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

Wiki&amp;rsquo;s are websites that are quick and easy to contribute to and to edit.

&lt;p>The program monitoring program at goldsmiths has recently changed to a new model. This arrangement uses online tools to compliment the traditional Course Rep role to set an agenda for a number of meetings over the course of the college year between the academic staff and the students. As a Program Monitoring Rep I was at the first of the meetings today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was an agenda. These are my reflections on that meeting. Disclaimer. I would probably say all of the following again. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it anything more than my opinion.

I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring what other ways the information that is stored in the library building can opened up to the benefit of students and staff alike. I&amp;rsquo;m not so much speaking about new things that the library can do, rather I am interested in ways in which existing services and resources could be linked up, extending their use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently recommendations for reading / viewing / listening are distributed to students as files to download from &lt;a href="http://learn.gold.ac.uk" title="Goldsmiths Virtual Learnign Environment website">learn.gold.ac.uk&lt;/a> (which we usually print) or in hard copy (which we then annotate). Students then navigate to the library website to find out whether a given publication is &lt;em>even available&lt;/em>, and what its shelfmark is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is the potential to make the process of recommending, finding, borrowing and even commenting on the value and relevance of a particular library resource more seamless by linking-up the library website and learn.gold site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>study tools</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/study-tools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 22:32:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/10/23/study-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve invested a lot of time in researching and testing tools to support my studies. i wanted to to break away from so-called &amp;lsquo;productivity tools&amp;rsquo;, as in all my years of using software like Visio, Word, Outlook, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been productive: too much of my time and effort has been wasted in taming the application, or repeated manually generating my desired formatting - perhaps counter-productivity tools would be more accurate.&lt;/p>

A seat has become vacant in the Stonebridge Ward following the death of Councillor Dorman Long. A by-election will be held on Thursday, 13 September 2007 to elect a new representative.
The by-election gives the Lib Dems another opportunity to win a seat - but will they win it? I doubt it. Stonebridge ward is a Labour heartland - you only have to look at the votes cast in the 2006 Local Election to see that&amp;hellip; Winning this single seat will not change the overall political balance of Brent Council: The Lib Dems would need to win a few more by-elections or benefit from defections (not for the first time in Brent&amp;rsquo;s recent political history) in order to be in a position to leave the alliance with the Conservatives and lead a majority administration.</description></item><item><title>comments reopened</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/08/03/comments-reopened/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2007 08:51:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/08/03/comments-reopened/</guid><description>akismet API key installed so now my wordpress rocks with anti-spam for comments</description></item><item><title>Electoral Canvassing 2007</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2007/08/03/electoral-canvassing-2007/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2007 08:50:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2007/08/03/electoral-canvassing-2007/</guid><description>The 2007 Electoral Canvass is about to start.

Shahrar told me about meeting Brent residents while campaigning during the local elections and a common gripe that came up - being issued with a ticket on a public holiday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He writes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Trouble is, &amp;ldquo;Restrictions apply on Bank Holidays&amp;rdquo; signage is to be found only on some of the posts as one enters the zone. But most people, reasonably in my view, take their cue from the signage in the bays - which without any explicit indication to the contrary they will assume does not apply on public holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brent can&amp;rsquo;t have it both ways. Had the assumption not been justified there would hardly be a need for the additional signage. The trouble is these signs are not fit for purpose, ie. noticeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s at issue? Nobody likes to get a fine at the best of times, but the suspicion is that signage has been erected to maximise the chances of catching people out and making a quick buck. That&amp;rsquo;s dishonest and only fuels resentment towards local government - increasing cynicsm and eroding trust in public or democratic institutions, moreover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SKNDC community network ideas</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/19/skndc-community-network-ideas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2006 08:44:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2006/09/19/skndc-community-network-ideas/</guid><description>Last year SKNDC advertised for interested parties to propose solutions for a wireless network project in South Kilburn.

Comwifinet had prototyped the Civic Reporter framework which is inspired by other innovative mobile technology projects, such as that implemented by Lewisham and the mySociety &amp;lsquo;Broken Civic Infrastructure&amp;rsquo; idea. These similar initiatives all start from the question &amp;lsquo;Would putting pictures of abandoned cars on a map on the internet help people to think again about their role in maintaining a tidy Borough?

The little puzzle we have been working on has been incorporating the Apple OS X machines into the authenticated file and print network.

&lt;p>6 April 2006&lt;/p>
&lt;p>QUEEN&amp;rsquo;S PARK TOWERBLOCK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people have been asking me about the Council&amp;rsquo;s plan to put a 26-storey towerblock on the car park next to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park Station. The Council is not prepared to have an open public consultation about the proposal. My view is that the people who elected me as their councillor deserve to be informed about the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Council was in extensive pre-application talks with the proposed developer, Genesis, from at least the middle of 2004. In April 2005, the Council amended the planning guidance relating to the site to allow for a building of up to 20 storeys paving the way for Genesis&amp;rsquo;s planning application for a set of twin 26-storey towerblocks. The Council persuaded them to withdraw it in September 2005 due to the unexpected level of public opposition to the proposal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>where did the logo go?

Thankfully the Electoral Commission website is a wealth of information on electoral law and regulations.
Election expenses are those ‘expenses incurred whether before, during or after the election, on account of or in respect of the conduct or management of the election’. They may only be incurred by the candidate, his election agent or persons authorised in writing by that agent.</description></item><item><title>See what happens when you win an election...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/09/see-what-happens-when-you-win-an-election/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2005 14:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/09/see-what-happens-when-you-win-an-election/</guid><description>This graphic was generated from the hit data to this blog between the 3rd and the 9th of May 2005.</description></item><item><title>Brent East Campaigning - A review</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/09/brent-east-campaigning-a-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2005 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2005/05/09/brent-east-campaigning-a-review/</guid><description>Over 6 weeks &amp;amp; 53 postings the Brent East Campaign has been blogged.

For every one vote the Greens receive, the Conservatives are getting seven, the Liberal Democrats 45 and Labour 47 = 100 votes.

What was curious about the materials was the lack of photographs - no pic of Rainbow George, no pic of Tony Bush and George Blair.
A preferendum is an experiment in participatory democracy.

Dear Sarah Teather,
Yesterday afternoon a group of MPs launched a campaign to impeach Tony Blair for &amp;ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanours&amp;rdquo; in the run up to the war against Iraq.
As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will agree, the prime minister still has a case to answer regarding his role in persuading parliament to support the war in Iraq.</description></item><item><title>Something to show and tell.</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/27/something-to-show-and-tell/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2004 08:37:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/27/something-to-show-and-tell/</guid><description>Blogging has been light this last week or so.

&amp;ldquo;Too many politicians think they know what&amp;rsquo;s best, without taking the time to listen to local people. I hope that Brent residents take the time to fill in the survey so that I can take up their issues both with the local Council as well as taking them up in Parliament.</description></item><item><title>WTF!

Announcing her actions, Sarah said:
&amp;ldquo;Derelict phone boxes are an eyesore in Brent. Local residents are sick and tired of seeing them being used as rubbish bins, fly-poster sites and public toilets.

First launched for the Stonebridge Estate in April this year, the program aims to provide new teams of uniformed officers working within communities to tackle quality-of-life issues and anti-social behaviour crimes.
Sarah commented that it was community policing that local people wanted. &amp;ldquo;Not only do they want more police on the streets, they want police officers who they know and trust.</description></item><item><title>The last survivors</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/the-last-survivors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2004 08:28:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/05/the-last-survivors/</guid><description>Lest we forget</description></item><item><title>What to do with ‘grot spots’ in Brent</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/04/what-to-do-with-grot-spots-in-brent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2004 17:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/04/what-to-do-with-grot-spots-in-brent/</guid><description>From what I can gather, there are two different options for reporting &amp;lsquo;grot spots&amp;rsquo; for action by the local authority.
You can report them to Sarah.
Or
You can report them direct to Brent Council&amp;rsquo;s Street Care Team.
For street sweeping, you can visit them online to report poor standards of cleanliness. The Street Care team promise they will be rectified within 24 hours. They will ensure that streets and roads are kept tidy, litter bins are emptied on a regular basis and to remove any dead animal from the highway within one hour of it being reported.</description></item><item><title>Humiliated, Angry, Ashamed, Brown.</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/04/humiliated-angry-ashamed-brown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2004 08:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/08/04/humiliated-angry-ashamed-brown/</guid><description>It can be difficult to tell the difference in a battlefield situation between a camera and a shoulder mounted missile launcher.

Good morning Mr Yeo,
You&amp;rsquo;re probably going to be reading a few of these messages today, so I thank you in advance for reading mine.

There has been much said on this topic in blogsphere of late. And with good reason. So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to repeat it here.
But I would like to highlight a few bits of the Guardian article.

I figured that the presences I had (for the wireless projects, for my mp, etc) were too targetted and therefore not suitable for adding random notices, pointers to flotsam, and typewritten scriblings.

Dear Mr Dyke,
Thank you very much for your e-mail about the two debates that Sarah took part in the week before last.
You mentioned that you had looked on Hansard and Theyworkforyou.com for the debates but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find them. Both debates took place on Tuesday 22nd June in Westminster Hall, which is separate from the main chamber of the House of Commons. Speeches made in Westminster Hall are still recorded in Hansard but are in a different section, which might account for why you could not locate them in the online Hansard.</description></item><item><title>The missing speeches...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/07/03/the-missing-speeches/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2004 16:20:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/07/03/the-missing-speeches/</guid><description>OK. After some further searching I found the speeches. Firstly, the reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the searches is that they were not made on the 1st of July as the news posts on the Brent &amp;amp; Brent East Lib Dem web site states and secondly, the speeches were made in adjournment debates in Westminster Hall, not in the House of Commons as the photographs would suggest.
So, updated with correct, relevent and contextual information, here is the Brent &amp;amp; Brent East Liberal Democrats &amp;lsquo;Content In Brief&amp;rsquo; for 2nd July 2004.</description></item><item><title>making the spoken word more informing...</title><link>https://robdyke.com/2004/07/03/making-the-spoken-word-more-informing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2004 15:57:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robdyke.com/2004/07/03/making-the-spoken-word-more-informing/</guid><description>OK.
