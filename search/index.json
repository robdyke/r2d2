There is usually an online dialogue between users and developersculminating in a 2-3 day event, in which solutions are developed and sometimes judged. Hackdays are used to develop solutions to problems that may not be solved by the \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo; processes. They are relatively cheap to operate, often conducted on a voluntary basis, they are sometimes organised by small business units and SMEs seeing aself interest in participation. As well generating intellectual property (IP) and solutions, hackdays create networks, relationships and creative energy which is unsurpassed by anyother networking event. However, there needs to be a clear route to market for the outputs of hackdays, for their true value to be realised by the community. The public sector procurement process is singled out as having the most to gain from using hackdays, to levelthe playing field and expose innovation.\nThis short paper describes the hackday process, examines the potential benefits, risks and routes to market and proposes ways for public sector organisations to use hackdays in support of procurement activities.\nCabinet Office is urged to take action to promote the use of hackdays in procurement.\nHackday Examples Examples of hackdays can be found in most sectors and even within large corporations. For example the first use of Skunkworks or Tiger Teams originated in the aerospace industry. Typically they comprise projects developed by a small structured group of people who research and develop a project from \u0026ldquo;soup to nuts\u0026rdquo; primarily for the sake of innovation itself.\nSimilar ideas include Innovation Games. Individual employees and contractors have made a practice of participating in hackdays inhigher education , clinical research, and healthcare. A quick look at the work of Developer Community Supporting Innovation - DevCSI (Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)Funded), Open Source Watch and the, Rewired State and NHS Hackday reveals theimmense potential of these events to stimulate innovation with both closed and open source software.\nCase Study : Open Data Platform The NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) Open Data Platform (ODP) Hack Week is a good example of how public sector organisations can embed hackdays inprocurement.\n “The ODP is expected to replace the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) that is currently provided by BT under the Spine contract due to expire in 2013, but which can be extended to 2016. This includes Payment by Results (PbR) service and is used to create Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets.”\n The HSCIC ran a \u0026ldquo;Hack week\u0026rdquo; inviting \u0026ldquo;open access and open technology specialists, to demonstrate and develop the architectural principles and pilot the technology which will form our Open Data Platform (ODP). Using real anonymised data, we will explore real information challenges and generate applications which will demonstrate how value can be extracted from the large datasets.\u0026rdquo;\nThe ODP proposal disaggregated the more traditional requirements-driven approach to procuring a \u0026ldquo;solution\u0026rdquo;. The intention was to replace SUS and related services, a servicewhich is \u0026ldquo;greater than the sum of its parts\u0026rdquo;. There are many components to SUS and the HSCIC recognise this. The ODP seeks to leverage contemporary component-orientedtechnology to provide SUS2.\nThe benefits to the HSCIC were the proving of market and proof of concept/technologystack. The \u0026lsquo;hackweek\u0026rsquo; was valuable for the HSCIC as the ODP was potentially a risky procurement in each of these areas. The high level of engagement from the SME /developer community proved the market interest in the ODP. The existing deployment andutilisation of many of the key components of the ODP will greatly de-risk future procurement.The hackweek also proved the integration and interoperability of the disaggregated component approach both in terms of technology and, most importantly, in terms of the work interfaces between organisations.\nIn terms of procurement the \u0026lsquo;hack week\u0026rsquo; expanded the market by broadening the number of potential vendors who could bid for components of the tender. With many of the key SUS/HES components being provided by a single vendor for so long the market was noteducated in the nuances of SUS/PbR. The benefits to the SME community were manifest in opportunity to learn about the SUS environment, the \u0026ldquo;secret recipes\u0026rdquo; previously locked into large contracts and obfuscated behind firewalls (soft, technical and legal). SMEs had the opportunity to work closely with the different user groups around the SUS platform and to form alliances with other SMEs to form soft/formal consortia to bid for components of the ODP procurement.\nHackday Conduct The humble and purely voluntary Hackday should have a strict code of conduct toencourage and enforce transparency, openness and collaboration for it to succeed. Participants need to sign up or agree to a code of conduct which needs to include:\n willingness to use and create Open Source software and/or creative commons materials to neutralise some the ownership and licensing issues which often restricts collaboration willingness to openly pre-declare any personal or corporate IP interests inhackday solutions, which could restrict collaborator exploitation willingness to indemnify participants against any future legal issues with IP derived from hackdays complying with the declared process of the hackday as specified by the organiser encouraging good presentation and documentation of the project on a shared wikisite  A suitably adapted version of this code of conduct would allow public sector procurement to use and benefit from hackdays in pre and post procurement phases.\nImagine a hackday called by users at any early stage of a procurement to clarify the requirements/design of a complex project. Imagine a “best and final offer stage' of procurement augmented by an open hackday attended by all SMEs hoping to be in the ecosystem of the winning bid. Imagine a hackday as a condition of breach of contract which allows for the introduction of new suppliers. Imagine a hackday called to establish new forms of interoperability betweenexisting systems, innovative platforms and a new release of a procured system which claimed high degrees of interoperability at the bid stage.\nHackdays can actively ensure the level playing field sought by the Cabinet Office open standards policy paper.\nPlugfests and Connectathons A related form of event is a “plugfest” or “connect-a-thon”. In this type of event the focus is on achieving practical interoperability between systems. These events are typically run withthe voluntary participation of companies that need to test the ability of their systems to work together.\nFor customers, these events provide a practical means of assessing the level of real interoperability in practice between systems rather than taking supplier claims on face valueor relying on compliance documentation. It also provides insight into the practical value andlevel of maturity of particular open standards.\nFor suppliers, a plugfest-style approach may obviate the need to engage with expensive certification processes that can exclude SMEs and open source solutions. It also enables suppliers to gain access to data, content and systems - such as those of competitors, or customer\u0026quot;s internal systems - they would not normally have access to for purposes of practical interoperability testing.\nPlugfest-style events need to operate under similar rules to other hackdays. For example, CETIS has facilitated a large number of “CodeBash” events in the education sector; although CETIS disseminates the outputs of the events, the specific performance of individual participants is not revealed to those that did not participate. Bug reports and technical issuesare fed back to relevant standards and specifications bodies; a general overview on levels of interoperability achieved is disseminated to the developer community and a list of participants is made freely available to identify those developers and vendors who have demonstrated a commitment to creating interoperability. All participants are free to publishing their own reports on a CETIS CodeBash, however they are strongly discouraged from publicising the performance of other developers and potential competitors.\nIt can also be beneficial for the process if events are organised and run by a neutral andtrusted entity, to ensure the right parties are invited, to moderate the process and create theright kind of atmosphere.\nIntegrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) has been running regular connectathons for itsmember firms for over 10 years. Connectathons are highly structured plugfests, moderatedby a suite of open source testing facilities, capable of connecting systems together and exchanging data through one of a predefined set of “profiles\u0026quot; which define the required orchestration of participating systems. The IHE profiles cover a range of healthcare specificactivity, such as scheduled workflow in radiology, pathology results transfer and clinical document sharing and user identity management. The connectathons are open any supplier with products capable of conforming to one of the IHE profiles and the profiles themselves are subject to open governance. Only positive performance is reported and published at theend of the events.\nWhen interoperability is a critical requirement for a solution being procured, our experience leads us to suggest that public sector organisations run these types of event during the procurement or pre-procurement process, and take note where potential suppliers areunwilling to participate. In addition, running these events over the life of an implementation project are important for identifying problems and evaluating progress, and so engaging inthem should be a requirement for suppliers whose systems or content is expected to interoperate with the rest of the solution.\nThe Benefits of Hackdays Many of the developers and users at hackdays are actively working to put solutions into projects and products as a result of participation. Success for a participant in a hackday cantake many forms, but getting a solution to the hackday shortlist as well as the recognition and respect this brings from their peers and the personal kudos this creates, can be rewardin itself. However the monetary reward of providing an in-production solution for customers isoften the short to medium term benefit that many seek and the current procurement process does not provide any guidance for the use of hackdays.\nHackdays are an example of re-energising, creative and rapid analytical thought to addressreal user problems in areas where innovation appears to have faltered. They focus onrequirements clarification, design testing, integration and rapid prototyping, can take users,buyers and suppliers to a new level of understanding and create new intellectual property inthe process.\nThe benefits of hackdays are:\n understanding the role of open source in supporting “collaborative innovation” raising the energy levels in both procurers and suppliers to “do something” networking for future collaboration activities understanding of requirements, issues, and standards for the sector understanding of IT skills, standards and platforms understanding of what is easy and what is hard to do new intellectual property in the form of code and documentation made available for derivative exploitation clarity in the attribution of generated IP to the suppliers and procurers who participate  The soft benefits (1-6) should not be underestimated, particularly in a project or organisation,where innovation is severely lacking due to elimination of competition in the delivery phaseof procurement, or during the early stages of procurement when suppliers are afraid tochallenge stated requirements.\nItem 7 provides hard evidence of the value of the hackday. Hackday code is intended to befreely shared, downloaded, used or extended as necessary in production systems or products, with attribution (8) given to the parties involved in development.\nA hackday code of practice would normally define these terms as conditions of participation.\nUsing Hackdays in Procurement The UK public procurement process has remained virtually unaltered for 15 years, whilstincreasing in scope to cover all phases of end-end service design, implementation, deliveryand management in an attempt to ensure a through life cost comparison of bids. But buying services underpinned by software and other digital media has some unique issues:\nIP.\n Unique opportunity for intellectual property creation exists during in the early stage of most software procurements. Currently, everything in a contract is protected by commercially restrictive terms, but how much of current contracts need to beunique IP? Unique IP is normally only explicitly recognised and valued if it becomesan \u0026lsquo;issue\u0026rsquo; in contract termination or novation to another supplier. Rarely is genuinelyunique IP identified and attributed early in procurement, and this represents a huge loss in value creation for UK software Plc. NPfIT is a prime case in point: many of theideas in NPfIT were revolutionary in 2002, but due to being locked away under commercial wraps, its value has since evaporated. Hackdays would have examinedthe requirements in an open forum and identified the unique IP at an early stage.\n Standards.\n Current use of open standards in procurement to define software behaviour is immature compared with other goods and services, making it difficult toensure a level playing field through specification alone. Consequently, these complex specifications result in \u0026ldquo;big system\u0026rdquo; approaches for bespoke systems with no competitive source of subsequent support and maintenance. NPfiT, for example, took far too long in the post contract phase to define its own closed architecturestandards, understood only by a small club of contracted suppliers, causingknowledge and delivery bottlenecks. Hackdays can be used in the pre-contractphase to quickly disaggregate complex requirements into open data, open standardsand open and closed source software components, which can be specified asseparate lots in a procurement and supplied by a larger pool of smaller suppliers.\n Interoperability.\n The required Interoperability of products in procurement often goes unspecified and results in significant costs and delays in the integration of productsinto their environment post contract. Again using NPfIT as the example - theunplanned integration of central systems into hundreds of local environments wasone of the key reasons for delay and failure. If the contractors had been required to participate in a regular series of independently managed plugfests or connectathons,the number of successful deployments would have been significantly higher and this open form of engagement could have sustained the vibrant market for health IT thatis now having to be rebuilt.\n Client-side Software Skills.\n Software problems are difficult to track down and fixwithout a client-side understanding of software and a clear chain of command. The end-to-end \u0026ldquo;one-throat to choke\u0026rdquo; approach to procurement and been the justification of many public sector organisations to outsource their client-side software skills, leavingthem 100% dependent on suppliers and the minutiae of contracts. This approachwas central to the NPfIT strategy and caused a denuding of local in-house software skills. Hackdays help user organisations to rebuild trust and confidence in software developers to the point where they can think about rebuilding their internal software teams to make them less vulnerable to supply failure.\n Buyer Benefits from Hackdays But how can users and buyer organisations also gain from hackdays? What\u0026rsquo;s in it for them? Why should they share knowledge and commit resources to these events? Will EU procurement law, particularly around competition and fairness, allow them to use the outputof hackdays?\nFrom a user and buyer perspective, the knowledge gained from a hackday can in itself surpass any knowledge gained from sifting through the marketing, sales materials andcompliance matrices produced from existing procurements. But hackdays could also be an extremely powerful tool to address the risks of a large procurement:\nUse knowledge to build own client-side solution\n Buyers convert IP into acustomer project to build a solution with own or contracted developers\n Use knowledge gained to disaggregate requirements\n Buyers use the knowledgegained to disaggregate their needs into a more fine grained set of requirements,tendered for and delivered by one or more suppliers\n Use to score supplier bid evaluation\n Buyers could evaluate supplier participation in hackdays to provide an “potential to innovate” score for suppliers.\n Use to maintain a vibrant market\n Buyers could use plugfests and connectathonsto ensure that their system achieves interoperability with other relevant systems tomaintain vibrant market and flow of data through its supply chain.\n Risks from Hackdays Hackdays also pose a number of risks to suppliers and buyers which need to be managed such as:\n The perceived failure of a given hackday project, or product to deliver certainexpectations in a hackday, may cause a supplier and buyer concerns about theproduct moving forward Some suppliers may only have off-shore developer resources, and the cost of resourcing hackdays may be more than those with on-shore resources Some suppliers may challenge the ownership of hackday generated IP Using Hackdays in the procurement process may increase the risks of a supplier challenge under EU law. EU law prevents public sector buyers from making “discriminatory” selection decisions and bans any “negotiation” with suppliers during key phases of a procurement.  To counter these risks, Hackday organisers would have to ensure that\n any derived hackday information to be used in decision making is openly and fairly derived. Currently, any video , software and data recorded is entirely voluntary on behalf of the project. Such reporting constraints mayimpose unwanted burdens on some hackday organisers. Hackdays are announced with enough time for preparations to be made all hackday IP would either be open source or protected by participant indemnification, so that it can be safely used or suitably converted in any existing build, project or procurement at any time participants sign up to forego any threat of legal challenges based on hackday participation  Limitations of Hackdays Hackday IP is produced as a result of a high energy effort expended over a short time period, and solutions generated should be heavily caveated:\n The more complex the challenge the more likely the Hackday output is in nature afunctional prototype (available developer capacity) Due to the time constraints not all the requirements are understood and incorporated (available users / analysts capacity) The solution is not production ready (additional release management requirements,policy constraints)  Market benefits from Hackdays After a hackday, everyone should take a step back to review generated IP in the context of existing and proposed initiatives to achieve full deployment within an organisational setting. There appear to be two potential routes for suppliers to gain from the IP that spills out from a hackday:\nProductise\n Developer converts IP into an open or closed source licensable supplier owned software product\n Use in cloud service\n Developer converts IP into a user accessible cloud based service\n There is no value in trying to regulate this activity in the procurement process, as this is the stuff of creativity, risk and business. Suffice to say there is ample motivation for developers and suppliers to commit resources to hackdays.\nSummary More concerted central government action is required to exploit the benefits of collaborativeinnovation delivered by hackdays to help level the playing field for open data, openstandards, open source software and the SMEs which support them. As an example of the action necessary, an “open register” of hackday organisers could be procured via the Gcloud initiative to:\n raise awareness of the hackday process for procurement, apply more public sector legal rigour around the hackday process and IP generated signpost the organisations capable of delivering effective hackdays in differentsectors.  Another example would be for departmental sector sponsors including Cabinet Office toprovide funds to support hackdays where new ground needs to be broken.\nFinally, work to produce new guidance for \u0026ldquo;the use of hackdays in procurement\u0026rdquo; to address any perceived risks, would ensure broad take up and maxim benefit.\n","href":"/2020/04/08/hackdays-leveling-the-playing-field/","title":"Hackdays - Leveling the Playing Field"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/nhs-hackday/","title":"NHS Hackday"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/open-source/","title":"Open Source"},{"content":"Reposted here are the essays I wrote in my third year of my BA Politics (Hons) degree.\n","href":"/categories/ba-politics/","title":"BA Politics"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/dissertation/","title":"Dissertation"},{"content":"Introduction. The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. In this paper, I show how philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have engendered new forms of sociopolitical consumption and new political economies of meaning. My emphasis on the interplay between the local and the global/structure and agency, shows new ways of ‘thinking’ the cosmopolitan, sedimented in the interconnected networks of the technical age. My thesis is concerned with our present moment of opportunity. I believe that positive possibilities for politics and political economy are presented in the philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes. In this paper I will demonstrate the contribution of these new sociopolitical categories and the new politics that is being made public because of free/libre hacking.\nMy thesis explores two themes: networks and movement. I recognise in the literature around social movements, global politics and government a similar interest in networks that develops in tandem with advances in physical and technical networks, such as transportation, computing or utilities. I, too, am interested in networks in both social and technical senses of the concept. According to Parsons the network concept was attractive to social movement and public policy theorists of the 1950 and 1960s because this model was flexible enough to describe the fluid and complex interplay between both the formal and informal political and social relationships that condition political culture.1 During the 1980s the network concept was developed by a number of French sociologists. I have been particularly interested in the work of Bruno Latour in this area. He is associated with the Actor-Network-Theory (ANT), a sociology which claims that “modern societies cannot be described without recognizing them as having a fibrous, thread-like, wiry, stringy, ropey, capillary character that is never captured by the notions of levels, layers, territories, spheres, categories, structure, systems. [ANT] aims at explaining the effects accounted for by those traditional words without having to buy the ontology, topology and politics that goes with them.”2\nIn terms of global society, the network metaphor has been widely deployed in the field of international relations, economics, anthropology and socio-political geography. Most prominent is the geographer Manuel Castells whose seminal work The Rise of the Network Society3 considers the social and political dynamics created by the flows of people, goods and services, and capital around the world in terms of networks. More recent examples of the use of the network concept can be found in the ethnographies of ,4 the political/cultural research of ,5 and the socio-political geography of .6 The network concept has helped these authors to move beyond the ‘ontologies, topologies and politics’ of world systems theorists, hyper-globalist free-marketeers and models of dependency and development.\nMost crucial in the ANT approach is that this sociology includes the material; that is to say it recognises “the facts manufactured by natural and social sciences and the artefacts designed by engineers.”7 Some may be critical of this approach, fearing a technological determinism or a cyborg future. However, I agree with Benkler who, in arguing that strict technological determinism8 is false, states that “different patterns of adoption and use [of a certain technology] can result in very different social relations.”9 Benkler finds wealth in the network and not in nations, as Adam Smith did. His argument in The Wealth Of Networks considers both the technological and social aspects of relational (re)production in networked society.\nThe closely related ideas of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have developed in a similar time-frame to the network concept. These ideas have developed symbiotically with the rise of networks in the technological sense too, most crucially the global information-computation network, the internet. Computer hackers and political activists Richard Stallman and Eric S. Raymond along with lawyer Laurence Lessig are the people most strongly associated with free/libre and open-source philosophies and commons regimes, respectively.10 These individuals are recognised as pioneers in their areas and their work is widely cited. Stallman’s work is focused on articulating and developing the free/libre philosophy and curating several ‘constitutional’ documents. For Raymond, amateur anthropologist and ‘accidental revolutionary’, it is the socio-economic manifestation of free/libre philosophy as open-source in a networked society that is of importance. In his book he explores what he perceives as a shift from organisational hierarchy, which he describes as a Cathedral, to the contrasting horizontal networks of a Bazaar. Lessig’s work focuses on the problematic relationship between culture and property in advanced capitalist societies, concentrating on commons regimes.\nA second aspect of my dissertation is concerned with movement and movements, again considering social and technical aspects. I am interested in social movements, for example the socio-political organisations considered by New Social Movement (NSM)11 theorists, and in technical movement, considering the flows of signs and symbols in transmission. Both movement and movements are considered through the rubric of global networked society. The groups and communities around free/libre and open-source philosophies and commons production regimes form what has been described by many as a New Social Movement. I am interested in the movement of concepts and practices from free/libre and open-source groups to other social movements and political organisations in our networked society.\nMy approach in this thesis is to pay attention to both the interconnectedness of nodes in networks, be they biological or techno-sociological, and the movement of signs and symbols in those same networks. I have taken a hyper-networked attitude in my thesis. There is nothing but networks or, to use Latour’s words, “there is no aether in which the networks should be immersed.”12 In this sense the network concept is both reductive and relativist. Yet, when considered in parallel with the political philosophy of free/libre, open source, and commons ideals, the network concept takes us towards an ontology that is relational and not reductive. I acknowledge the atomic, i.e. indivisible, nature of each individual being. Yet, my ontology of this being also recognises the multi-dimensional inter-connections, that is to say the networks that each individual is a node in.13\nMy dissertation has four parts. Firstly, I pose the question ‘Who Governs in a Networked Society?’, considering the effect of global dynamics on modern conceptions of subject, governance and sovereignty. The post-modern history of our contemporary geospatial and political present presented by Hardt and Negri in Empire14 has been a critical influence on my thoughts on networks and movement in this regard.\nFreedom and openness are two central concepts in hackerism and the contemporary social movements it has influenced. In the second section of this paper I explore in depth the political philosophy of free/libre and open source ideas that have arisen from hacker culture. In examining the epistemology of these emerging redefinitions of freedom and openness I demonstrate the challenges and opportunities they present to the corresponding dominant liberal notions of the same terms.\nThe third section of this paper engages with the question of production and reproduction under the conditions of ‘communicative capitalism’15 and the ‘positive possibility’16 presented by free/libre and open-source conceptions of the same.\nThe “contemporary proliferation of political spaces and the multiplicity of democratic demands”17 needs a new politics, a politics that works at the global and the local level, the universal and the particular. New relationships of interconnectedness between people, communities, identities, artifacts, locations and events need to be reflected in the political culture of our institutions. What are the dynamics of these relationships? How are these new political movements creating spaces in our networked society? Furthermore, with “advocates of freedom in the new digital society […] decried as pirates, anarchists, communists”18 by the those who dominated the imperial/industrial economy - those who have the most to loose - the stakes are clearly high. We are witnessing, as Moglen announces in his work The dotCommunist Manifesto, “the arrival of a new social structure, born of the transformation of bourgeois industrial society by the digital technology of its own invention.”19 This networked remixing and retransmission of free/libre philosophy, directed back at the forces of capital in liberal democracies that (re)produced and conditioned its emergence presents, perhaps, the challenges and the new opportunites for radical political communities and political economy. The effects of free/libre, open source and commons in transmission will conclude my dissertation.\nWho Governs in a Networked Society? Dahl asked ‘Who Governs?’ and found a gradual shift from oligarchy to pluralism.20 Barry’s Political Machines21 was concerned with ‘governing a technological society’…This section, then, develops both of these lines of enquiry and can be conceived as ‘Who Governs in a Networked Society?’ I am concerned with the present and the shift from pluralism to networked society. My focus here is to consider ‘interconnectedness’, revealing the relationships in and between complex social systems. I contend that ever increasing complexity and ever greater plurality developing in tandem in the political, economic, and cultural spheres has two parallel consequences. First, the depoliticisation of sites government and second, the politicisation of areas of the social world previously outside of the scope of government. This has two implications for political communities. First, with the depoliticisation of government comes increased disconnection of politics from its community. The links between governors and governed becomes weaker and other interests can expand into this political space. Second, the politicisation of aspects of the social world creates new political communities and new political activities, destabilising established governmental structures.\nThe network metaphor, associated with sociologist Antony Giddens22 and geographer Manuel Castells23, is a rhetorical framework for considering the complexity of the interconnectedness of contemporary cosmopolitan cultures. This metaphor has, in Barry’s assessment, become a “critical term in contemporary political and economic life…associated with a broad range of political opinion, and deployed in association with what might appear to be quite contradictory political strategies.”24 The strength of this metaphor is its ability to describe both the moment and the movement of the social world, the situated actors and their agency. The complex and often contradictory relationships of human social existence are not obscured by deploying this concept. Just as some aspects of the social world are hierarchical and regulated, and some are rhizomatic and anarchic, the metaphor of the network draws attention to these two aspects. Most recently the term network has become closely associated with information and communications technologies, especially with the internet - the prefix inter- highlights again my theme of connectedness, of ‘being among’. “However” as Parsons councils us to remember, “against this is the weakness that the metaphor is highly diverse in its use and interpretation.”25 To clarify my use of this concept then as it relates to the question of “Who Governs in a Network Society”, I am denoting the complex formal and informal inter-relationships of communication and power in the context of contemporary technologically mediated social exchanges.\nI find the network society metaphor significantly more sophisticated than the ‘globalisation thesis’. This is because a network is local at all points and global only by association and interconnection. The network metaphor is universal in that it is social.26 A further reason for not resting my argument on globalisation is that this notion is frequently grounded in the empirical reality of the boundaried nation-state. “This epistemology which starts out with society as a given, consisting of so many closed, bounded entities…contained entities in interaction with an equally contained society [was] modelled on the state, with its clear boundaries vis-à-vis other entities.”27 Yet, this is precisely where these models fall down - the functional and reductionist primacy of the nation-state “can not capture the increasing complexity of reality in their apparatus; that is, complex in relation to earlier assumptions.”28 In contrast the ‘networked society’ epistemology does not start out with nation-states and society, rather it reflects the increased complexity of interactions in relation to earlier models of society.29 This description of contemporary world society reflects the stabilising and destabilising, territorialising and deterritorialising tendencies of global flows in political, economic, legal and social networks, transmuting individuals and communities, associations and corporations, states and state-like actors.\nIt is this transmutation that is of critical interest to a number of writers who argue that this shifting of the traditional markers of certainty of the global social order denotes not a quantitative change, but a significant qualitative change in global interactivity. I am positing here a decline of the nation-state vis-à-vis the emergence of a cosmopolitan and networked society; yet this is not the whole story - I am concerned here not only with the decline of traditional governance in a networked society, but also with the politicisation of areas of the social world previously outside of the scope of government.\nThinking first then about the depoliticisation of government in the networked society. I perceive that the previously contained polity of a given nation-state has been cross-cut as the network modality of global society diminishes the containers of imperial sovereignty. The world has, as Paul Virillio describes, been turned inside out like a glove.30 The global is now inside, no longer ‘out there’, elsewhere. Geospatial boundaries such as the nation-state can no longer be the centre of our contemporary political and economic order. Rather, these local structures have been pushed to the outside; sovereignty is now inside, pushing outwards, a centrifugal force. He writes “…the pips are no longer inside the apples, nor the segments in the middle of the orange: the skin has been turned inside out. The exterior is not simply the skin, the surface of the Earth, but all that is in situ, all that is precisely localised, wherever it may be.”31 This is a reorientation of political geography of as great a significance as the Copernican revolution.\nModernity’s conceptions of zonal time and delineated borders are reshaped by the immediacy and ubiquity of transnational networks, both electronic and physical. The physical distance between the real cities of London and Baghdad remains the same as in the imperial age. Yet, our contemporary relationship to that same distance has altered radically. The distorting effect of contemporary high speed and large scale movements of symbols over seemingly vast expanses of space at a time-warping velocity necessarily tends to the concentration and centralisation of power.32 For Virilio, the complex interplay between the power concentrated in the real city and that in the virtual city causes the imperial politics of the former to give way to a deterritorialised metropolitics of a universalising and totalitarian character.33\nFor Hardt and Negri this real/virtual dichotomy is a catalyst of a spatial-temporal reformulation of sovereignty leading to a total networked interdependence in Empire.34 This new supranational sovereignty, Empire, arises from a “shift in contemporary capitalist production and global relations of power…to bring together economic power and political power, to realise, in other words, a properly capitalist order.”35 The paradigm of Empire emerges positively from the “definitive decline of the sovereign nation-state[s], by the deregulation of international markets, [and] by the end of antagonistic conflict among state subjects.”36 Empire is a mixed paradigm of supranational sovereignty based on rights and the realisation of these rights through inter-networked complex systems. Empire tends towards “governance without government” which further problematizes my initial question. This does not lead, according to Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s analysis, to a power-vacuum, rather to the very depoliticisation of politics and the politicisation of the social world that I am concerned with in.\nThese two takes on contemporary globality from Virilio and Hardt \u0026amp; Negri each describe the depoliticisation of modern government and the site of government, the nation-state, and find the cause to be the diminishing sovereignty of each. In our networked society governments of nation-states are now one-actor-amongst-many within their notional territory, rather than the sovereign power that the modern International Relations ‘realist’ paradigm of ‘black-box sovereignty’ holds.37 In reality the sovereign decisions of governments are overturned by transnational quasi-governmental organisations such as the World Trade Organisation, local jurisprudence is rewritten because of a judgement by an international court, peoples national ‘commons’ are enclosed as a conditionality of international financial or political support.\nNew social movements are another example of such actors in our networked society.38 These movements are diverse in support, objectives and strategies. The annual gatherings of NSMs at the World Social Forum (WSF) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) demonstrate fantastic abundance of nodes and associations in the network, from independent and voluntary sector organisations, to trades unions, from grassroots organisations, to international trade confederations, trans-national business, philanthropists and other non-state actors.39 Most crucially the WSF and the WEF demonstrate the organising and mobilising power of these networked movements. The rhizomatic character of these actors contributes to the destabilisation of the hierarchical centralised structure of the state. The causes of these new social movements are the new political spaces in our networked society.\nHerein lies a critical paradox, demonstrative of current hegemonic interest-group in our networked society, and leads us closer to understanding ‘who governs’. When an aggregation of NGOs concerned with ecology or poverty mobilise to protect the extinction of an ecosystem or to prevent mass-starvation, national and transnational governmental structures appear to tense up, disrupting flows of information and restricting action. The heavily policed, proscribed protest zones and the dividing security fences for G8 / WTO meetings, or the political ‘long grass’ of cross-party investigative commissions are two examples of this. Conversely, the capitulation of national and central banks to transnational financial business interests during the present ‘credit crunch’ demonstrates how these same governmental structures can rapidly mobilise action to protect the interests of capital.\nWhile NSMs may not been able to hold the state hostage to their interests in the same way that private capital does, these movements can and do mobilise, again through networks, hundreds of thousands of activists for campaign objectives. Forty years on from the social change brought about by the movement of people on the streets; the peace movement, the student movement, the civil rights movement: what hopes are there for social change from New Social Movements in our global networked society?\nFor Hardt \u0026amp; Negri the discourse of New Social Movement theory has “done a great service by insisting on the political importance of cultural movements against narrowly economic perspectives that minimise their significance.”40 However, they contend the post-materialist basis of New Social Movements has been accepted uncritically, that is to say NSM discourse “perpetuate[s] narrow understandings of the economic and the cultural” by failing to take into consideration the “increasing indistinguishability of economic and cultural phenomena.”41 Therefore social movement discourse needs to develop new frameworks capable of addressing this tendency towards the convergence of economic and cultural phenomena in a networked society. Free/libre, open-source and commons conceptions recognise this convergence and, I argue, offer a rich contribution to NSM discourse. This is an avenue I continue to explore in a later section.\nSeveral theorists of network culture argue that the increasing transnational mobility of both individuals and symbols in a network society should challenge us to think again about other dimensions of politics. The work of Appadurai in exploring “the image, the imagined, the imaginary…the imagination as a social practice”42 in a networked society considers one such dimension. He argues that “the imagination has become an organised field of social practice, a form of work (in the sense of both labour and culturally organised practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility.”43\nAppadurai’s transnational ‘mobility without moving’, of identities and cultures in transmission, is made possible by the ever expansive ‘building out’ of the infrastructure of global networks, interconnecting the social world. The interaction of global flows of images, identities and cultures in the networked society adds further complexity to the constitutive effect of images, the imagined, the imaginary. The question of ‘Who Governs’ is further problematised, too. When the identity of each individual in any given polity is, if not constructed, then at least influenced by these global flows, that polity itself is destabilised from within. The extreme plurality of contemporary liberal societies tends towards ‘governance without government’ as a remedy to this destabilisation.44 This manifests itself in two ways. The first can be seen in the institutions of government in the establishing of bi-partisan committees or agencies at arms length of the state, and therefore from the democratic process, depoliticising governance in pursuit of third-way politics. The second aspect of ‘governance without government’ is more a counter-weight, a response; here we see NGOs/NSMs as powerful aggregations of individual interest, operating as the moral exclamation in resistance to the first depoliticisation. The site of representation and resistance is now global and networked. Conditioned by this, these movements are their own network and the network extends the movement.45\nHow then are we to understand political struggle when the site of representation and resistance is now global and networked? The most crucial characteristic of the network society, as described by Hardt, is that “no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated […] by an indefinite number of others.”46 This means that political struggle in our networked society is no longer directly antagonistic, yet neither is it passive. The resistance and activism movements organised within networks “displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow.”47\nThese social processes of depoliticisation / politicisation are global. As Castells describes the cyclical events…“societies evolve and change by deconstructing their institutions under the pressure of new power relationships and constructing new sets of institutions that allow people to live side by side without self-destroying, in spite of their contradictory interests and values.”48 The shifting nature of power in a networked society is amplified and accelerated as the plural and contained polity of the imperial age gives way to the networked society.\nI began this paper asking ‘Who Governs’. In journeying beyond the waining imperial order into the politics of the networked society we have seen the destabilisation and deterritorialisation of the site and agent of government, the nation-state, and recognised the distributed and diffuse nature of power in our networked society. I have considered how the same destabilising effects of global networks have had an affect on the identity of the individual, the subject of sovereignty. The problem of ‘Who Governs in a Networked Society?’ has become more complex, provoking more questions. Two goals emerge clearly from this discussion, the articulation of a new ‘network aware’ ontology and an account of politics in a network society. Both are needed in order to begin to frame and answer to the question ‘Who Governs’.\nThe Free/Open Community. The networked meshing of hackers, artists and activists has made public free/libre, open-source and creative-commons concepts.49 This section will consider the hacker identity and hacker social and cultural relations. I posit that increasing contact with f/los \u0026amp; creative-commons artifacts, technologies and economics and the wider dissemination of f/los \u0026amp; creative-commons memes is raising popular consciousness of several emerging redefinitions for concepts such as freedom, property, production and ownership. Freedom and openness are two central concepts in hackerism and the contemporary social movements it has influenced. This section examines critically the political philosophies of hackerism in order to reveal the meaning of these emerging redefinitions of freedom and openness and the challenges they present to the corresponding dominant liberal notions of the same terms.\nTo hack is to play, to learn, to survive.50 The hacker supports his/her own being through the application of his/her individual characteristics in relation to his/her social and material conditions and gains pleasurable satisfaction in doing so. As MacKenzie Wark puts it in A Hacker Manifesto, the hacker “produces the possibility of production, the possibility of making something of and with the world - and of living off the surplus produced by the application of abstraction to nature - to any nature.”51. The hacker disposition is demonstrated in the real, lived lives of humans and the development of all human civilisations. What I am suggesting by ascribing these characteristics to all humans qua human is that the hacker is the innate modality of humanity. Hacking, according to Wark, discovers “the nature of nature, its productive - and destructive - powers. This applies as much in physics as in sexuality, in biology as in politics, in computing as in art or philosophy. The nature of any and every domain may be hacked. It is the nature of hacking to discover freely, to invent freely, to create and produce freely.”52\nTo hack is also to subvert and resist. The desire to hack the information society emerges negatively, in opposition to the challenge of increasingly rapid enclosure of the immaterial and cultural commons and against the dislocation from history and society that virtual and networked property relations effect. Indeed, as both Wark and Himanen have argued, it is the hacker who is capable of answering the property question in capitalist societies by proposing an “alternative spirit for the network society”53 creating “new kinds of relation, with unforeseen properties, which question the property form itself”54. This presents a challenge to the dominant spirit of contemporary advanced capitalism. The hacker proposes free production and free access in contrast to the private property of capital. I will return to these new kinds of relationships later.\nModern freedom, the liberty of contemporary liberals, emerged negatively, as a revolution against the dominant absolutism and authority of the pre-modern period. The freedom of free/libre also emerges negatively, a revolution against the widespread practice of enclosure of technologies and the encroachment of enclosure in the academy. In Revolutions OS55 Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation and computer hacker, describes his hostility the to enclosure of the ‘tools of his trade’, in this case, software, in the guise of ‘intellectual property.’56 He felt his was being forced to “sign a promise you won’t share [software] with anybody else.” He continues…\n “And to me that was essentially a promise to be a bad person, to betray or cut myself off from society, from the cooperating community. So, I just wasn’t going to do that. I felt this is wrong. I am not going to live this way.”57\n This led Stallman and others to develop and share free and open tools. This work began in the 1980s under the banner of The GNU Project58 and led to the foundation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Stallman’s political and legal work is part of the foundational philosophy of the free/libre and, later, open source movements.\nThe freedom Stallman and the FSF espouse in the Free Software Definition (FSD)59 is free-as-in-freedom, that is to say positive freedom: ‘free-as-in-speech’ not ‘free-as-in-beer’, i.e. gratis, no charge. The four freedoms of the FSD are:\n  Freedom 0 - The freedom to run the program, for any purpose\n  Freedom 1 - The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n  Freedom 2 - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour.\n  Freedom 3 - The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.60\n  Stallman’s reasoning behind this radical stance is evident in the title of his collected essays Free Software, Free Society.61 He askes “what kind of rules make possible a good society that is good for the people in it?”62 The FSD goes some way to answering that question. The FSD describes “the freedoms that enable people to form a community.”63 The definition seeks to protect an individuals’ “right to cooperate with other people and form a community.”64 Stallman’s point is clear: “if you don’t have all these freedoms [in the FSD], you’re being divided and dominated by somebody”65 Some hackers, such as Hill and Coleman, contend that the “four freedoms” of the FSD are “based in and representative of an extreme form of anti-discrimination resistant to categorisation into the typical “left, centre and right” tripartite political schema.”66 Yet free/libre is not completely resistant to categorisation. I contend that the ‘freedom’ of free/libre is based on an appeal to rights, an exclamation of a right of self-determination and self-selection of a community and of property. Therefore, in many respects, the definition of the “freedom” ideal-type for free/libre is markedly liberal and individualistic in ontology and political economy.\nThe FSF is, however, only one voice among the multitude of f/los hackers, artists and activists; the radicalism of the FSD is only one expression of hackerism. The free/libre philosophy in transmission, as one set of symbols among many in a networked society, can be found in different practical articulations. That is to say that by “recalibrating the broad meaning of freedom outlined in the FSD to align with their own philosophies and politics…groups perceive [f/los] as a model of openness and collaboration particularly well suited to meet their own goals.”67\nHere the second part of the f/los acronym emerges, open-source.68Open-source can be read as simply a technology development methodology that co-opts the advantages of free-software development - principally freedoms 1 and 3, open access to the source-code - while playing down its freedom principle. Open-source can also be described as a social movement. The ‘cause’ of this social movement is the adoption of open-source practices; its strategy is the neutralisation of free-software, ‘recalibrating the broad meaning of freedom’ as put forward by Stallman in the FSD, in order to become more business-friendly. There is a third reading of open-source which shows its political implications. Opening the source code requires an attitude of openness towards modification, duplication and redistribution. Open-source, therefore, becomes a metaphor for transparency, for accountability, for democracy; a point to which I will return. Openness necessitates and configures new social relationships and creates new political spaces.\nBuilding on the central motifs of the networked society, the information economy and contemporary organisational theory, Raymond muses on the phenomenology of open-source in a number of essays, collectively published as The Cathedral and the Bazaar.69 He notes a shift from hierarchical models of organisational, that he refers to as ‘the Cathedral’, to a more ad-hoc horizontal organisation model that he calls ‘the Bazaar’. The Cathedral model symbolises the paradigm of industrial production, the competing industrial giants of the 20th century, and the Bazaar model symbolises the paradigm of open-source production in a networked society. There are other parallels that can be drawn from his observation. The centralised and hierarchical Cathedral model can be viewed as analogous to the waining structures of modern government that are being destabilised and deterritorialised by the rise of an open-source networked society paradigm, Raymonds’ rhizomatic Bazaar model.\nOpenness conditions new social relationships and practices with new technologies in a new political space, the networked society of the Bazaar. For Anderson the dynamic co-development of human societies and technologies conditions the social order.70 The ‘nation’ is an imagined community manifested in ‘states’; the emergence of this political category in the 19th century is closely related to the spread of technologies that increased inter-personal communication in vernacular languages. The global networks that have extended and accelerated communications in our contemporary world have facilitated the multiplication of imagined communities which now scale globally. The idea of ‘community’ is frequently evoked in f/los discourse and most f/los activity takes place within a group, with disparate and dispersed members. Hacker communities are the archetype of a networked community. The role of ‘the community’ in maintaining and distributing knowledge and in inculcating a good f/los civic values is central to the hacker ethos.\nI contend that the networked communities and the political cultures they condition provide useful examples for positive changes to our social order and practices. Many different New Social Movements have co-opted the symbols and practices of free-software as well as deriving benefits from the free software produced by hackers. An example of f/los in transmission to social-political activism, which is frequently presented, is IndyMedia.org. This is “ a collective of independent media organisations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage. IndyMedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth.”71 The openness of open-source fits with the radical transparency of this network of movements and the free/libre software produced by hackers sits easily with the broadly anti-capital stance of IndyMedia.\nThere are other more mainstream examples of the implementation of open-source methods at the organisational level, the use of free/libre software tools at a functional level and the general adoption of the principles of collectivism, active and open participation, and consensus decision-making and sharing through the organisation. The emergence of ‘social source’ may be defined narrowly as the “marrying [of] open source software development with social service and social change applications”72, or, more, broadly as the marrying of open-source principles and free/libre production and distribution with the express goal of social change. The ‘civic hacking’ of the mySociety organisation embodies in every way the positive socio-political potential of f/los, building technological tools to open up governmental activity and reinvigorate democracy.73\nSo, in summary, I have sketched the transition from hierarchy to rhizome, from the monopolistic monolithic structures of the industrial age to the distributed, diverse peer-nodes of networked society. There are further questions to ask: of a future f/los society of individuals participating in communities, producing and socially sharing with each other? Rhizomatic democratic networks overcoming the tyranny of both structure and structurelessness? What of the tendency towards transnational cosmopolitan ‘governance without government’? Before returning to the challenges for the contemporary political order, I will discuss the hack of the dominant economic system presented by free/libre philosophy.\nHacking Communicative Capitalism. In the previous sections I considered the networked society paradigm, the philosophy of free/libre and the practices of the open-source movements. I now turn to explore how a free/libre political economy of social production and reproduction might challenge the dominant liberal ‘free-market’ political economy of late-stage capitalist market economies.\nThe dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. For example Terranova’s Network Culture: Politics for the Information Age74 has but a few notes on ‘Software: freeware \u0026amp; open-source’ but none on free-software. This is a disappointing omission because it is an opposition to, indeed, the political act of resistance to, enclosure that created the free-software philosophy in our information age. As Prug observes in his examination of the ‘political act’ of free/libre activity, Hardt and Negri manage two references to the open-source movement in Multitude.75 Terranova and Hardt \u0026amp; Negri, perhaps willingly, omit the origins of open-source in free-software and as a result miss the challenge to capitalist property rights that free-software presents. To address these failings, in this section I consider questions of production and reproduction under the conditions of ‘communicative capitalism’76 in search of ‘positive possibilities’77 presented by free/libre and commons conceptions of the same.\nIn Empire Hardt and Negri, like Marx before them, demonstrate that capital has an expansive character. Just as the hacker sees no boundary to what may be hacked, capital similarly has no boundaries, expanding into culture, science, and sex. The expansion and increasing sophistication of production possibilities, created from nature by hacking, necessarily increases the sophistication of the capitalist system. The contemporary economic paradigm has been variously described as a digital economy, an information economy and a weightless economy. Yet I think that Dean’s concept ‘communicative capitalism’ most accurately describes the complexity of this conjuncture, by properly retaining a reference to ‘captialism’!\nDean’s term highlights the economic reconfiguration of communication, referring to the networked movement of information and the production of affect, in a technologically mediated society.78 In conceiving of capitalism as communicative in this way, Dean brings to the foreground the social and technical aspects of informational capitalism in networked society. By social I am referring to the affective dimension of production and reproduction, taking a biological turn similar to Hardt and Negri in their use of Foucault’s concept of biopower.79 The ‘biological turn’ can thought of as a “techno-scientific reconceptualisation of life”80 away from the hierarchical structures and the centralisation of power of modernity’s oligopolistic Cathedral model of organisation and production, towards more ad-hoc, rhizomatic network conceptions, such as the Bazaar.\nBy technology, like Appadurai, I am referring to technology high and low, both physical and informational technologies. Similarly, Barry demonstrates that global regimes, such as ISO certifications and international ‘intellectual property’ regulation are equally technological as more conventional understandings of technology, such as equipment and scientific knowledge.81 Dean’s term ‘communicative capitalism’ reflects this understanding of technology. It reveals the multiple sites of contestation and diverse technologies of mediation in “rhizomatic communications networks that are themselves biopolitical, generative, productive, of capital, of subjectivity, of life itself.”82\nCrucial to my argument here are the concepts of abstract labour and of immaterial production. These post-workerist terms move beyond the over-determined political subject of the industrial proletariat and describe the biopolitical nature of production and re-production under communicative capitalism.83 Using these categories, we can see that all collective labour is channelled and structured within the logic of capital.\nThe informatisation of cultural labour and production, and of that information then becoming property under the conditions of communicative capitalism, tends towards the increasing indistinguishability of economic and cultural phenomena. The publishing of creative works as commodities and the digital distribution of these works blurs the markers of the industrial production paradigm. From abstract labour and immaterial production similarly abstract property forms emerge, such as ‘intellectual property’ and patents, accompanied by copyright regimes to protect these new property forms. With the modern site of rights, and of rights protection, diminished in our networked society the defence of the rights of the holders of these new property forms becomes increasingly problematic. The battle for protection of these abstract property forms becomes global, with communicative capitalism accelerating the expansion and normalisation of transnational structures of ‘governance without governing’, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the Organisation Internationale de Normalisation (ISO).84\nThe WIPO understand ‘intellectual property’ as referring to “creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.”85 For Stallman and the FSF, “the term “intellectual property” carries a hidden assumption - that the way to think about all these disparate issues [copyright, patents, trademarks] is based on an analogy with physical objects, and our ideas of physical property.”86 Johnson is critical of the FSF position, insisting that the “word ‘intellectual’ is used as a prefix to ‘intellectual property’ precisely to distinguish it from material or real property.”87 This definitional argument doesn’t necessarily require resolution, as it is serves me here just to highlight the problematic relationship between culture and property in advanced capitalist societies. If culture is understood as art, science, code, the radical diversity and interdependence of all human knowledge, then the enclosure of knowledge, its commodification as exchangeable property, deprives humans of access to it.\nThe hegemony of liberal political economy models in the realms of technology and culture is demonstrated by the spread of international patent protection and ‘intellectual property’ law. The radicalism of free/libre concepts in transmission to non-software realms, particularly to virtual and abstract labour, but also to cultural production in general, have created the revolutionary abstractions of copyleft, a hack of contemporary capitalism’s notion of copyright. It has also created creative-commons, a hack which institutionalises a opening dynamic of sharing against the closure of patents and licensing.88 Copyleft and the creative-commons subvert the regimes of copyright and ‘intellectual property’, reusing the main symbols of the latter pair of concepts to make public a new logic.89\nThe free/libre hacks of copy-left and creative-commons are based on an appeal to the rule of law, demonstrated by the constitutional nature of the Free Software Definition and the codification of expressions of the FSD in various licenses.90 The appeal to the rule of law of much of free/libre discourse demonstrates the neo-liberal character of free/libre. How does this mean we should understand free/libre’s first principle, freedom? For Hardie, the freedom espoused by the FSF in teh FSD is a freedom “bound intimately with the logic of open democracy and with free and open markets.”91 On this reading, the political economy of free/libre, is subversive only because it appears counter-intuitive. That is to say it appears paradoxical within the axioms of the capitalist market to produce only to then give away what is produced.\nPrug’s work proposes a broader reading of free/libre philosophy as radical hack of the regime of rights in general. His approach demonstrates a true positive possibility in the free/libre hack of communicative capitalism. By hacking rights in favour of egalitarianism over meritocracy, the property rights central to liberal capitalism are changed from the substantive ‘right to’ and the normative ‘right of’ property to a ‘right in’ property, which is both substantive and normative. As Prug argues, “Stallman re-conceptualised the idea of rights to encourage [a] volunteer, co-operative and decommodified society with the notion of shared wealth.”92\nInfluenced by the openness of free/libre philosophy the idea of Open Capital93 re-conceptualises other logics central to communicative capitalism in a radical hack of the terms ‘profit’ and ‘loss’. In a departure from the “competitive economy based upon shareholder value and unsustainable growth results from a transfer of risks outwards, and the transfer of reward inwards,”94 Open Capital neutralises the conflict created by that centrifugal/centripetal strategy, by hacking ‘profit’ and ‘loss’ to ‘reward’ and ‘risk’, as defined by all participants in the network, to result in a mutually satisfactory exchange of value from the productive activity.\nIn conclusion, free/libre presents opportunities for reconfiguring the logic(s) of communicative capitalism. Now I return to the political question of organisation and resistance, of the wider translation of the free/libre hacks of political categories and concepts.\nHacking a Free/Open Politics. The “contemporary proliferation of political spaces and the multiplicity of democratic demands”95 in our networked society needs a new politics, a politics that works at the level of the global and the local, the universal and the particular. New relationships of interconnectedness between people, communities, identities, artifacts, locations and events need to be reflected in the political culture of our institutions. What positive benefits can free/libre and open-source in transmission to our wider society bring to politics? How are we to move beyond the individualist ontology of liberalism and a politics dependant on capital? What hope is there for a new ontology of interdependence, a way of being among?\nI have outlined changes in political culture that the adoption of open-source principles of collectivism, participation and consensus decision-making by organisations and institutions have produced. I have also considered the reconfiguration of economic activity through the liberating free/libre hack on property rights. In this section I will bring these threads together, imagining a free/libre open-source society which shares, and shares widely, the wealth of networks, grows open communities and strengthens democracy. No longer can free/libre and open-source be dismissed as ‘merely metaphorical’ or utopian. As van den Boomen \u0026amp; Schäfer point out, “there is more at stake than just a vague metaphor for a transparent, democratic and non-private constitution. Of course, notions of ‘freedom’ and ‘openness’ appeal strongly to the social imagination, and this can easily result in utopian daydreaming.”96 Let us recall Appadurai here, reminding us that the imagination is a necessary part of any innovation, that ‘imagination is a social practice’, both a form of work, and a form of negotiation between sites of agency and globally defined fields of possibility.97\nI argue that the relational and constructive ontology of the hacker and free/libre and open source ideas are beginning to displace the dominant liberal homo economicus, the rational utility-maximising consumer of communicative capitalism and the protestant work ethic associated with Weber.98 This reemerging homo socialis recognises his/her historical and social situatedness, both of which homo economicus is emphatically encouraged not to reflect upon by the propagandistic and manipulative efforts of communicative capitalism’s individualistic and ahistorical modes of thought.\nThe network society deconstructs modernity’s institutions and constructs new institutions that reflect the dynamics of new power relationships. Free/libre is a radical hack of the institution of rights, disrupting and reconfiguring the power relationships of property and demanding new politics relevant to the networked society. I’m not going to quibble with the liberal basis of much of the hacker ontology and the free/libre political philosophy. I’m all for free, autonomous individuals solving their own problems in relationship to their material conditions, adding to the sum of human knowledge. It is the logic of capital that reconfigures this knowledge as property and wields property as power. A politics for the networked society need not reject the symbols of liberal economics, and certainly must not reject the values of democracy. Yet it must move beyond the structuralist epistemology of the nation-state as the container of politics.\nIn Multitude, Hardt and Nergi outline four interpretations of either a challenge or contribution to democracy from the globalisation of capital.99 On the ‘left’ of the political spectrum, the social democrat sees global capital as an obstacle to democracy and in response strengthens the democracy of a people through the nation-state and uses this site to regulate capital. The liberal cosmopolitan perspective recognises a contribution to democracy from globalisation and in response strengthens the democracy of the people through global citizenship. On the ‘right’, the neo-liberal response favours the globalisation of capital, viewing this as inherently democratic. While the ‘traditional values conservative’ response, similar to that of the social democrat, seeks to retreat behind national borders. I agree with Hardt \u0026amp; Negri that “none of these arguments […] seem sufficient for confronting the question of democracy and globalisation.”100 They place their political project, the global democracy of the multitude, outside this categorisation.\nCapitalism’s crucial contingency is the principle of liberty, which is commonly understood as the protection of private property through regimes of ‘property rights’. The anti-globalisation stances of the social democrat and the ‘traditional values conservative’ each uphold the regime of property rights against global democracy by strengthening the state / capital relationship. While the pro-globalisation stances of our cosmopolitan liberal and neo-liberal again uphold the regime of property rights, this time using global democracy to form a supra-state / capital relationship.\nOpen-source is firmly within Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s categories as markedly liberal in terms of its pro-globalisation and pro-democracy stance. Indeed open-source in and of itself is not anti-capital. Free/libre on the other hand is outside these categorisations: it is radical. It is anti-capital because it hacks (subverts) the dominant property rights regime of capitalism. It is pro-globalisation and pro-democracy in as much as it is radically free, open and egalitarian.\nIt is certainly true that much of free/libre and open-source discourse, like NSM discourse, “perpetuate[s] narrow understandings of the economic and the cultural”101 by failing to take adequately consider the increased mixing of economic and cultural phenomena. To a certain degree, free/libre, open-source and creative commons concepts are all “various forms of social contestation and experimentation, all centred on a refusal to value the kind of fixed program of material production.” On the other hand, recalling my earlier argument for a reading of open-source as a social movement to further the adoption of open-source; free/libre, open-source and creative commons have all ‘sold out’ by voluntarily channelling and structuring themselves within the logic of capitalist exchange.102\nThe challenge for free/libre in transmission in a networked society is two fold. Firstly to recognise that these ideas are more than “‘merely cultural’ experimentation” in isolation and that ideas have a “very profound political and economic effect.”103 The second challenge for these ideas is to recognise and guard against the counterrevolutionary responses to the effects that they have. Against the free-software revolution came the counterrevolution of open-source. So to some extent open-source can be considered a powerful pacific weapon, neutralising the anti-capitalism of free/libre. Open-source networked production and the openness that that entails has the appearance of transforming the economic relationships of late capitalism. However in reality no such transformation takes place as the fundamental logic(s) of communicative capitalism remain intact.\nThe undecidable nature of the relationships between the hacker, who produces abstractions, and global capital, which extracts value from these abstractions is revealed in the cyclical adaption and cooption, of a pattern of deconstruction and construction, between free/libre and open-source and communicative capitalism. The positive possibility of free/libre needs defending from the unremitting attempts at neutralisation by neo-liberal and liberal cosmopolitan aristocrats. What the ‘liberal aristocrats’, or as Žižek would call them, the ‘liberal communists’104 who perverted free/libre into open-source “do not understand is that in the era of biopolitical production, liberalism and liberty based on the virtue of the few or even the many is becoming impossible.”105 Hardt and Negri continue, arguing that “the logic of private property is being threatened by the social nature of biopolitical production.”106 The transformative hack (subversion) of private property rights by free/libre philosophy recognises the social nature of production, a point sadly missed by Hardt and Negri.\nThe liberal communists have vehemently adhered to the Weberian spirit of capitalism piously accumulating wealth by the sleight of hand of open-sourced enclosure. True to the Weberian logic, the liberal communists demonstrate their virtue through a directed distribution of this wealth. This ‘open philanthropy’ is not a hack like ‘open capital’, rather it is ‘philanthrocapitalism’, an appropriation of the symbols of open-source to extract private profit first and to ‘do good’ second. So, while entering into ‘tactical alliances’ with the liberal communists may be necessary in order to win local, specific, ‘subjective’ gains, as Žižek reminds us, they are the “agents of the structural violence” of communicative capitalism: “liberal communists are the enemy of every true progressive struggle today.”107\nOur re-emerging homo socialis is able to overcome both the tyranny of structure and of structurelessness by adopting the radical politics of openness in social practices and institutions.108 The monolithic structures of corporate bodies such as business, state agencies, and social movements are restructured by openness. The radical transparency of openness reveals the critical interdependency of our social relationships. The adoption of openness for an “open-source society” makes possible a deep public scrutiny and democratic accountability, but, most crucially it encourages collaboration in new, better social programmes.109\nThe new politics configured by free/libre philosophy and the practice of openness are an integral part of the ecology of the pro-democracy, pro-globalisation and anti-capital networked social justice movements, described here by David Graber:\n “This is a movement about reinventing democracy. It is not opposed to organisation. It is about creating new forms of organisation. It is not lacking in ideology. Those new forms of organisation are its ideology. It is about creating and enacting horizontal networks instead of top-down structures like states, parties or corporations; networks based on principles of decentralised, non-hierarchical consensus democracy. Ultimately, it aspires to be much more than that, because ultimately it aspires to reinvent daily life as whole. But unlike many other forms of radicalism, it has first organised itself in the political sphere - mainly because this was a territory that the powers that be (who have shifted all their heavy artillery into the economic) have largely abandoned.”110\n The free/libre hack of neo-liberal property rights presents the possibility to re-populate the abandoned political sphere with a politics of self-determinisation and of being in common, ‘reinventing daily life as a whole’. The radical principles of openness present the possibility of a lightly structured networked society, of self-governing individuals, self-organising the movement of movements.\nNotes on the production of this text My dissertation was produced using only free-software and open-source tools.

The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:\n Free Redistribution  The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.\n Source Code  The program must include source code, andmust allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.\n Derived Works  The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n Integrity of The Author’s Source Code  The license may restrict source code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.\n No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups  The licensemust not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor  The licensemust not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n Distribution of License  The rights attached to the programmust apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\n License Must Not Be Specific to a Product  The rightsattached to the program must not depend on the program’s being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program’s license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.\n License Must Not Restrict Other Software  The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.\n License Must Be Technology-Neutral  No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\n  Creative Commons License Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nYou are free:  to Share  – to copy, distribute and transmit the work\n to Remix  – to adapt the work\n  Under the following conditions:  Attribution.

First and foremost his theory of globalisation emphasises identity and perspective over institutions and nation-states, the spatial and temporal over the economic and political; in this sense Appardurai’s theory of globalisation is post-modern. Secondly, his approach is post-structural: Appadurai is challenging other models of social theory that are based on models of structure. Appadurai’s theory of globalisation goes beyond the usual dualisms of global/local relations with an account of the effect of deterritorialisation and global cultural flows on the construction of identity by individuals, ‘communities’ and that of the nation-state. My discussion of Appadurai’s theory of globalisation will consider these elements and give an account of his metaphor of scapes.\nBefore we begin, however, we must draw a distinction between theories of globalisation and globalisation theory. Appadurai’s thesis is of the former and represents a “spatio-temporal reformulation of social theory”1 of the sort that the latter might ground themselves on. Where accounts such as centre-periphery models associated with Wallerstein2 and Gunder Frank3, migration theory models and the network models of Giddens4 and Castells5 do consider time and space, they neither emphasise these dimensions to the degree that Appadurai does, or consider only effective dimensions to the exclusion of affective dimensions.\nTheories of globalisation/globalisation theory can be roughly divided into system approaches and cultural approaches. Within these groups three further categories emerge, illustrating different perceptions of pervasiveness: sceptics, transformationalists and hyperglobalists6. Theories of the former see culture as a surface phenomenon, which demonstrates the human tendency to organise and categorise perceptions and experience, with universal underlying ordering principles that are the same. These principles are usually descibed in terms of binary oppositions or dualisms: centre/periphery, micro/macro. Culturalist approaches are also prone to binary thinking, with global/local dichotomy used frequently. These dualisms each delinate boundaries, objectifying a closed entity for study. And whilst deliniating political and cultural approaches to the modern world I too have perpetuated a dualism, the “hegemonic separation of the political and the cultural, of the building of the state and the construction of meanings.”7 Where globalisation from a cultural perspective discusses cultural homogenisation (a loosely disguised fear of Americanisation) and cultural diffusion, globalisation from a system perspective discusses economic vis political themes: these are ultimately perspectives on the same coin. Appardurai’s thesis is a challenge to this binary separation and a call to recognise perspective.\nAppadurai’s Modernity At Large8 is not explicitly a work of political economy or political theory. His book is a challenge to the academic discipline of anthropology to “\u0026hellip;come in from the cold and face the challenge of making a contribution to cultural studies without the benefit of its previous principal source of leverage - sighting of the savage”9. He believes that anthropology must radically rediscover its self in order to discharge its history as ‘the handmaiden of Imperialism’ (passim). Appadurai’s perspective as an anthropologist and his approach to the study of human social interaction shines a new light on the topics of ‘modernity’ and ‘globalisation’ for neighboring disciplines. His contribution to cultural studies is his idea of scapes. This typology of technoscapes, mediascapes, financescapes, ethnoscapes and ideoscapes, describes global flows of technology, media images, finance, people and ideas, respectively.\nAppadurai sees our modern world as interactive in a “strikingly new sense”10 and his framework of scapes is an attempt to delineate and describe the relationships of it. By technoscapes the sum total of technology transfers is meant; both high and low, physical and informational technologies. Barry’s Political Machines11 explores the contents of technoscapes. Barry demonstrates that international standardisation, such as ISO certifications and international intellectual property regulation are a part of Appadurai’s technoscape along side more conventional examples of technology; equipment and knowledge. Mediascapes refer to the modern milieu of imagery and text, distributed by new-media. A facet of Appadurai’s anthropological approach to a theory of globalisation is identity politics, mediascapes are deliniated distinct from other scapes due to the cultural role of the media in the invention, or to use Appadurai’s term, the ‘imagination’ of identity. Related to to the identity function of mediascapes, are “the dilemmas of perspective and representation” brought about by “changing social, territorial and cultural reproductions of group identity”12 that are the themes encompassed by ethnoscapes. A recent example of international money flows, Appadurai’s financescapes, can be seen in the ‘run’ on British bank Northern Rock. The reselling of packaged debt from mortgages taken up by Americans’ considered sub-prime borrowers lead to a crisis of confidence in international money markets leaving a British bank unable to meet its daily cash flow requirements. This caused panic amoung depositors of the Northern Rock and required government intervention to rescue the institution. The themes of his final scape, ideoscapes, are the “elements of the Enlightenment world view”13; specifically the chain of ideas, terms, images: freedom, welfare, rights, sovereignty, representation; that condition trans-national relations.\nA criticism of this metaphor is that Appadurai does not provide an objective account of the shape or topology of the spaces of these scapes in contrast to other models of interactions in our modern world, models which are frequently grounded on the empirical reality of the nation-state. This approach - the making of what is studied into a neat component before studying the relationships from and to it - is the modus operandi of many globalisation theories. “This epistomology which starts out with society as a given, consisting of so many closed, bounded entities…contained entities in interaction with an equally contained society [was] modelled on the state, with its clear boundaries vis-à-vis other entities.”14. Yet this is precisly where these models fall down - their functional and reductionist primacy of the nation-state ‘can not capture the increasing complexity of reality in their apparatus; that is, complex in relation to ealier assumptions.’15\nAppadurai does not take the nation-state as a bounded entity for the (re)modeling of other entities, nor is he compressing the nation-state from above with trans-national actors as systems models do, nor from below with global actor agency networks, often modeled in New Social Movement studies.16 Yet the nation-state is not negated by Appadurai. He sees modernity as challenging the traditional ideas of nation states and of national identies. Nation states and national identies need to understand themselves in a new way, as a ‘node’ in a “complex transnational construction of imaginary landscapes.”17\nAppadurai’s account of modernity is perspectival and highlights how circumstance means that any perspective is both refracted and partial. Nustad’s chapter in Eriksen’s Globalisation18 elaborates three perspectives on perspectival accounts of modernity. Firstly the distorting effects of speed and scale, a theme that Paul Virilio has examined at length19, can confuse association and causation. This is evident when considering the same event through micro and macro lenses, or from ‘the centre’ or ‘the periphery’: the distinction is really two perspectives on the same point. Secondly Nustad demonstrates that a network is local at all points, global by association and yet not universal. Nustad’s third point is that perspective can only ever be partial, creating uncertainty.\nThe identity politics that figure so prominantly in Appadurai’s work exhibit a Hegalian conception of human development, of self-consciousness becoming self-conscious, and a strong role of the psychodynamic in the fore-grounding of the imagination and of the imaginary refraction and inflection of images mechanically produced and trans-nationally distributed, of shared imagined communities, of diaspora and other imaginary constructs, of landscapes of mediated aspiration. “[T]he imagination has become” for Appadurai, an “organised field of social practices, a form of work, and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility.”20\nTime and space for Appadurai are affective on the imagination and identity. The imagination is not a-historical, nor bound by the present; both the future and past can be imagined and recalled. The realisation of this imaginary dimension to time and space plays havoc with the standard western linear chronology and significantly challenges all paradigms based on this conception: evolution, social hierarchy, colonisation, \u0026amp;tc. Identity remains related to ‘primordial’21 anthropological concerns such as kinship and land. Yet the post-modern identity described by Appadurai is also affected by imagined trans-national flows. Identity and imagination then are crucial to the perspectives of individuals and groups. This will inevitably lead to difference in perceptions and account for disjuncture; the agency of co-operation and of conflict. ‘Disjuncture’ and ‘difference’, then, mark out the contours of scapes and the points at which they meet with other scapes, in a given circumstance.\nOne approach to appraising the utility of a brace of new social terminology such as Appadurai’s scapes, disjuncture and difference, is to ask does it explain what it attempts to explain and, most crucially, to what extent are existing social theories displaced by a successful response to their long-standing problematisations. The question for the ideas in ‘Modernity at Large’ is, then, has Appadurai provided us with a compelling meta-narrative with his scapes? Does he displace the established world-systems theories that have been useful to us in analysing the world? Is Appadurai’s metaphor really another macro-level world system theory and therefore open to the same criticisms as Wallerstein and Gunder Frank as being telelogical and deterministic?\nAppadurai’s scapes challenge to the social sciences is to leave behind the universalising tendencies of the dualistic conceptions outlined above to find new ways of representing the links between the imagination and social life, especially as the imagination is “part of the repertoire of every society, in some culturally organised way.”22 As individual identity and imagination is inspired by memes in the macro as well as the micro, Appadurai’s scapes are a way of stressing the importance of “large-scale realities in concrete life-worlds”. The imagination is offered many visions of the world and of what is possible in it through mediascapes. These include positive, empowering and emancipatory ideas as well as the most “brutal and dehumanising of circumstances, of harsh inequalities”. From this milleu of realities and ideas that come from elsewhere, identity is imagined, “[t]hus, standard cultural reproduction (like standard English) is now an endangered activity that succeeds only by conscious design and political will, where it succeeds at all.”23\n‘Conscious design and political will’ clearly refers to what Marxist accounts of globalisation might describe as the power relationships that structure circumstances and the actions of individuals and groups in them. Power relationships are equally part of neo-liberal political thought. Appadurai’s theory of globalisation, while describing the multiple dimensions of identity, does not account for these power relationships and how they might condition and dominate the identity of individuals and groups.\nAppadurai is drawing our attention to the complexity in fully fractal, polythetically overlapping world and stressing that established macro-metaphors and micro analysis of social theory are woefully unprepared to examine this chaos. “…[T]he great traditional questions of causality, contingency, and prediction in the human sciences” would now be framed by Appadurai “in a way that relies on images of flow and uncertainty, hence chaos, rather than on older images of order, stability, and systematicness.”24 While he has not fully displaced other social theory, his work is an “economical technical vocabulary and a rudimentary model”25 which invites further development from the social sciences.\nBibliography Appadurai, Arjun. 1996.

Our political task is to reverse the order.” Keith Hart1\n The long established savings and loan institutions are criticised at every point, from the financial models that they operate down to their de-personalised, off-shore call-centres. My argument in this paper is that banking services are anti-social, hierarchical and intensely private. These traditional banking services are, I contend, inherently undemocratic, even anti-democratic at the extremes. However, contemporary challenges to these established models are emerging, presenting the possibility of a more sociable, democratic alternative.\nI have spilt my paper into three sections. To commence I will sketch an outline anthropology of money. By using this perspective on the political economy of money I hope to separate money and markets from capital and capitalism. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with money per se, rather that it is the institutions and mechanisms that manipulate money that have distorted its purpose, de-coupling money from the social circuit it was once attached to.\nWhat do I mean by social, peer-to-peer and participatory models? How do these approaches differ from the dominant mode of providing financial services? To answer these questions, in the second section I will draw on case studies of Zopa, Kiva and Open Capital to demonstrate these newly emergent business models, comparing and contrasting these models with their traditional correlate.\nMy first case is Zopa, a peer-to-peer virtualised financial marketplace. My second example is Kiva, a peer-to-peer international microcredit for development facilitator. My third case study will look at Open Capital, a business model for participatory community infrastructure projects on a significant scale. My research for these case studies is based on interviews with key individuals in these organisations, in the case of Zopa and Open Capital. For all three case studies materials have been sourced from the public web presences of the organisations as well as from secondary sources.\nI will contrast the relationships configured by these new models with those of traditional banks. In so doing I will expose and criticise the crucial purpose of banking - that is, to create money from debt, the making of money from money. I will examine the possibilities for and consequences of the (re)socialisation of these transactions. As a contrast to private banking models I will explore traditional social lending models; co-operatives, mutual socities, building socities. These fading models, some long since capitalised and now floated on stock-markets, will also be contrasted to contemporary peer-to-peer models.\nFor each case I have considered the following three aspects: sociability, scalability and sustainability. In terms of sociability, I am interested in how ‘social’ these models are and to what extent they are democratic in terms of participation, opportunity, access and governance. As to the scalability of these models, I have considered the size and duration of loans offered and the reach of services provided. With regard to the sustainability of these models I have been examining the long-term profitability of these models, where appropriate, and have assessed the ability of these models to withstand fluctuations in the global financial network of which they are an inseparable part.\nDrawing on my case studies, in the third section I will consider to what extent capital can be democratic. As will become clear in my examination, by democracy I am thinking in terms of decision-making and governance on the one hand and in terms of access to capital and financial services on the other.\nMoney: Global, Social and Virtual  “Most of the confusion existing in monetary theory [is] due to the separation of politics and economics, this outstanding characteristic of market society”2\n Money, according to anthropologist Keith Hart, is global, social and virtual.3 His ethnography of money describes it as a ‘memory bank’, storing the value of transactions that humans wish to calculate. Conceptually, money is necessarily global. Specific currencies are local to a given nation-state, such as the Yen in Japan or the South African Rand, or local to a federation of states, such as the Euro in Europe and the Dollar in the United States of America. Money, however, is global insofar as it is a medium of exchange between localities. Currency exchange, speculation and trading, while certainly transactions in themselves, are not conducted with the same motives and outcomes as the purchasing of goods and services, where money is the medium of exchange, not the commodity exchanged. That money can take a material presence in the form of cash merely disguises the fact that money doesn’t exist, only currencies exist physically. This may seem like an obvious distinction but it is a necessary one to make in order to de-couple money, a medium of exchange, from capital and capitalism, a system of exchange.\nMoney is a social construction. The classical liberal economic narrative has it that it was brought in to being in order to resolve a specific need, the need to exchange commodities between producers and users indirectly. Money displaces the barter mode of the traditional marketplace by enabling transactions between multiple producers and consumers of different goods and services to take place over greater distance and over extended periods of time than would be possible by direct exchange. The classic economics texts of liberal John Locke and communist Karl Marx both contain this analysis of the social utility of money.\nTo say that money is virtual in our contemporary society would be no exaggeration; there is insufficient currency in circulation to back the deposits in banks in the event of a run on a single bank, let alone the whole of the global banking system.4 Increasingly the cash currency used for daily transactions is being virtualised with smart-card technology.5 To say that money has always been virtual is to recognise the purpose of money in a global society. Money is virtual, according to Keith Hart, because it is a symbol, the medium rather than the object of exchange. That the accumulation of money, that is to say the creating and increasing of profit for wealth, has come to dominate exchange in a marketplace is due to the pervasive nature of capitalism. There is a second sense in which money is virtual: Karl Polanyi demonstrates that money is a ‘fictitious commodity’ along with labour and land.6 Each of these fictitious commodities has a fictitious price attached to it. For money this is interest; with labour, wages; for land, rent.\nTechnology has increased the scale and scope of virtual money. Information processing and communications technologies have allowed money to travel further and faster through ever more complex circuits and abstractions of exchange. As technology becomes increasing integrated into the public and private lives of individuals and the operations of companies it contributes to an increased awareness of the variety of goods and services offered in a global marketplace, enabling both the instantaneous comparison and acquisition of goods or services. Furthermore, communications technologies mean that there is no longer a need for physical co-presence in order to access these goods or services. This last point is crucial to my argument that the re-socialisation and democratisation of money and financial institutions is possible, a point to which I will return.\nStocks of money, that is to say capital, are considered a raw material for the capitalist market system as much as minerals mined from the land and the productive capacity of labour. Money is made from money in a capitalist system in two distinct ways. The first is the most obvious means and is intrinsic to capitalist market economies. Capital is consumed as a raw material to make goods or to create services which can be sold for a profit. Profit replaces the raw capital and adds to its stock.\nIn all this talk of virtual money, goods and services and raw capital I’ve masked the social world, the people and their activities that these transactions describe: people, businesses, communities, institutions making decisions based on their aspirations, expectations, calculations. Paying for education, starting a business and building infrastructure often involve significant amounts of money. Borrowing money is one way of financing these transactions.\nThe second method of making money with money is the deceptively simple process described by the economist J. K. Galbraith. It is to this institutional practice of the creation of wealth embodied in the banking industry, sanctioned and guarenteed by the coercive force of the state, that I now turn.\nInstitutions  ‘The process by which banks create money is so simple that the mind is instantly repelled. Where something so important is involved, a deeper mystery seems only decent.’ John Kenneth Galbraith7\n  Les billets de banque sont protégés par le droit pénal.8\n Contemporary business models of the banking industry are criticised for a lack of transparency, impersonal relationships, heavy systematisation and structural exclusion from services. These criticisms of banking institutions and debt money are magnified at the international level. Against these institutions new models arise: is it possible that we are witnessing a re-socialisation of banking along the lines of a post-modern Baily Savings and Loan9 or a new modality of capital?\nBanking institutions have created the vast majority of money in our societies from simple promises to pay them money. These promises, which are enforced by the coercive force of the state, are interest bearing. As Karl Polanyi describes, “interest is the price for the use of money and forms the income of those who are in the position to provide it.”10 The debt or credit, i.e. the capital sum, is increased by the levying of interest for the providing of the service of safe-keeping of deposits or for the facility of credit. The former promise bears less interest than the latter, reflecting, according to the rationale of the banking industry, the risk involved in extending that financial facility. This understanding of money is explored in the activist motion picture Money as Debt.11 However you don’t need to be a money-crank to accept the most basic argument presented in the film: banks create money through debt. The net difference between those two rates of interest (that paid on deposits and charged on credit facilities) when understood as the money that it represents, rather than interest percentages is the profit made by the bank.\nAs I have outlined, profit for institutional lenders is made by charging interest on credit services minus the interest paid to depositors. Yet, this is not the whole story; the business models of traditional banks are dependent on bad debt and the upselling of additional financial products to customers, such as payment protection insurance. Risk actuaries employed by the banks factor the profit that can be made from taking on sub-prime debt - debt with a greater probability of default than repayment. With promises to pay money “protected by the penal code” the true nature of interest-bearing business models is exposed: this is not a service but state-protected avarice.\nBanks are hierarchical in so far as they maintain a vertical structure in terms of tiered service provision for their customers (‘basic’, ‘silver’, ‘gold’, ‘platinum’ services levels for example12) and in terms of competition against each other. Furthermore, banks operate on the basis of anonymity and the reductive categorisation of their customers, identifying depositors and creditors alike as impersonal account numbers and sort codes in vast computerised databases. The relationship between a customer and his or her bank is governed by a privately factored credit score, distributed through agencies such as Experian and Equifax. It could be argued that these ratings agencies hold more power over an individual than the institutions that use them! A poor credit score translates into a higher rate of interest for credit, if credit is offered at all; indeed, a poor credit score is most likely to result in the exclusion of an individual from banking services, even from the most basic of bank accounts. There are no personal, that is to say social, relationships between the individual and his or her banking institution.\nA few further words on credit scoring are necessary before continuing. Credit ratings agencies operate on a number of different levels - from the rating of individuals, in the case of Experian and Equifax, and the credit worthiness of companies provided by international agencies such as Standard and Poor, to the credit scoring of entire nation-states in the case of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Credit agencies gather information on individuals, companies and nation-states from a variety of sources. Whenever credit is requested a search is made with these agencies for data held on the applicant. This data probably includes information on prior credit requests, the status of existing or historical credit provisions - whether discharged or defaulted - and other indicators on the likelihood of repayment of any credit extended to the applicant. I say probably because the topic of this data is not public: credit scoring depends on a shroud of secrecy.13 The opacity of credit scoring agencies and the private nature of the emphasis each individual bank places on a particular aspect of this data contribute to the charge of a lack of transparency in the banking industry. The ‘worth’ of an individual for credit, when expressed on a scale, reduces an individual human life to a metric. A question then for the emerging financial models I will examine is this: is there more or less use of these mechanisms by social lending business models? How is the ‘worth’ of an individual calculated by these models?\nCredit institutions have not always been anti-social, hierarchical, intensely private and motivated by profit. The Savings and Loan institutions in America and the Co-Operatives Mutual, Friendly and Building societies of the UK are examples traditional sociable credit services. These models are in decline, some extinct, unable to withstand the tide of global capitalism. However the themes of mutual aid, community and philanthropy central to these models are not lost, they are to be found in transmission, in new credit models, the social, peer-to-peer and participatory models that I will go on to examine.\nAgainst the hierarchical and secret nature of mainstream banking models there emerge new modes and practices emphasising horizontal and open structures. These new business models have three significant characteristics of difference from their mainstream counterparts: sociability, peer-to-peer and participation. As will become clear from the case studies I will present, each of these characteristics is understood in different ways in each of the business models, yet it is possible to tease out the aspects they have in common. These peer-to-peer, social and participatory financial models reflect autonomy, individualism and choice and the importance of post-material and post-modern values as a determinant on the economic activity of individuals and groups. Sociability is understood in terms of ‘community’: an ambiguous concept at the best of times, which here relates to the social interactions of individuals and groups around financial services and engaging in economic activity. ‘Community’ contrasts with the anonymous and alienated relationships embodied in mainstream banking. The term peer-to-peer (p2p) has its origins in the computer networks and the open source movement and describes rhizomatic communication between peers or points on the internet. In terms of these newly emerging models, what is described is a direct, ‘horizontal’, person-to-person transaction. In traditional banks decisions are made in a closed loop in which the debtor or creditor has little to no involvement. In contrast to this privacy, these new models emphasis the participation of people, as customers, in the decision-making process.\nCase Study: Zopa  “Lenders get great returns and borrowers get low-cost loans. And with no bank in the middle, everyone get better rates and money becomes human again.”14\n Use of the internet has been the deciding factor in the success of challenges to traditional business models in a number of sectors. Internet-based businesses are lean, a low-cost competition to established businesses due to the near-total automation of business processing and because they conduct their business without an costly physical co-presence. Internet start-ups aim to capture a share of an already active and profitable market. With the market for unsecured personal loans in the UK worth around 20bn GBP and the profits in banking significant, the financial services sector is often challenged by new businesses offering an internet-based alternative. Zopa is one such challenger. Zopa is a virtualised savings and loan marketplace, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. It differs from the high-street banking sector - it refuses the label of bank! - as Zopa holds no deposits for its customers and it does not loan directly from its own (ficitious) capital base to would be debtors.\nZopa provides two peer-2-peer lending marketplaces. The first is a managed lending service where Zopa does all the work and the lender simply collects on the returns.15 The second marketplace is much more ‘light-touch’ in terms of Zopa’s involvement. In this marketplace much greater control over rates and terms is devolved to the borrower and lenders to agree between themselves.16 The Zopa marketplace(s) connects people with money (fictitious capital) to people who would borrow it, for a price (interest). Is this person-to-person transaction really making money human again? This model of a money market is certainly virtual; to what extent is this money market social? How democratic is this model? I met with Giles Andrews, Zopa’s Chief Financial Officer, to discover more about the Zopa model.\nZopa understands sociability in three key ways. Firstly Zopa emphasises that their business is about people helping people. While this assistance is within an interest-bearing framework there is an element of philanthropic truth in this argument; replacing the depersonalised anti-social system of banking available on the high-street, Zopa empowers real people to make individual lending and borrowing decisions. Secondly Zopa provide a ’safe harbour’ for leaders and borrowers to conduct their business. The marketplace manages the risk involved in money-lending through the credit-scoring of applicants and by enforcing debts. Furthermore the Zopa marketplace is a secure electronic system regulated by the financial watchdog of the country of operation, increasing the security and safety of person-to-person lending.\nThe third aspect of sociability for Zopa is community and trust. The business model connects multiple lender’s with multiple borrowers with each individual borrower borrowing from a number of lenders, thus reducing the risk of loss to a lenders capital.This configures inter-personal relationships between borrowers and lenders, building a community around Zopa. These (pre-qualified) inter-personal relationships are strengthened by trust; Zopa emphasises this element of its business. The default rate for Zopa facilitated loans is significantly lower than the industry average.17 Repayment is encouraged as borrowers feel a personal connection to the lender(s), that is simply absent in the comparable relationship between a borrower and a high-street bank.18\nThe use of credit scoring is not diminished in this model as Andrews explained. Zopa make significant use of credit-scoring and ‘hand-check’ all borrower applications and there is no greater likelihood of acceptance from Zopa than any other institution. In fact, Zopa are quite risk averse in this respect because its person-to-person business model and the very competence of Zopa as risk assessors would be critically damaged in the event of widespread default by borrowers. Zopa are, however, much more social than high-street banks because they do not depend on bad-debt to increase the profitability of their business.19 For Zopa, however, the credit worthiness of an individual is not the sole factor on which a decision to loan money is made, because the lending decisions, the risk/reward speculation, is made by the lenders themselves. While a credit score does influence whether Zopa will accept a borrower into the marketplace, the credit-score is only a single part of a more complex decision-making process with lender(s) and the borrower engaging in dialogue over a transaction.\nThis radical transparency, in contrast with the ‘computer says no’ decision model of high-street lenders, does not end here. The crucial part of the sociability of the Zopa business model is precisely the inter-personal relationships that govern the loan decision. While a high-street bank bases its decisions on inpersonal metrics, Zopa lenders in the marketplace base their decisions on any number of other factors…perhaps I will not loan you the money for a season ticket for your team because I support another team…perhaps I will loan you money for a further education course because you intend to study a similar course or at the same institution that I did…I’ll loan you money for a new car but not not for a motorcycle as I think they are dangerous… In this sense Zopa is not masking the social world; the purpose of the loan and the readiness of the borrower to talk about themselves and the instrumentality the money will give them makes ‘money human again’…if only partially.\nHow scalable is the Zopa model? Andrews explained to me that Zopa’s target market is that of the unsecured personal loan, which is short in duration and low in value. That said, there is nothing to prevent Zopa, in terms of regulation, from scaling up their business and facilitating larger transactions; the provision of mortgages, for example. Two factors for a p2p lending business to consider in moving into this market segment would be the appetite of small lenders to tie-up their money for a significant period of time on the one hand, and the number of lenders and the amount of capital that would need to be pooled to provide a mortgage on the other. In terms of global scaling, due to different regulatory regimes for the different local financial markets of the world Zopa money is not able to be global. Although Zopa operates in a number of different markets; directly in the US and UK and with partnerships and franchises in other countries of Europe and in Asia, these marketplaces are not linked and it would be illegal to do so. In practice then Zopa facilitates local transactions in so far as a lender from the UK is not permitted to loan to a borrower in another country. Zopa’s scalability is then limited to the what new business it can capture within a specific country’s market and what it can poach from other lenders.\nHow sustainable is Zopa? If Zopa continues to grow its business at present rates it will gain a critical mass and become a serious challenge to the long-term viability of traditional high-street lenders. In the event of a widespread economic recession the challenge to Zopa would be different to that of traditional lenders. Zopa may even outperform others in the debt industry in the event of a liquidity crisis in the wider capital markets - remember Zopa facilitates p2p transactions rather than extending credit directly. The challenge to Zopa’s business would be to continue to make the money needed for its business to operate through its 0.5% service charge: if people do not borrow, lend or can not afford to repay loans the Zopa model would foreclose on itself.\nCase Study: Kiva  “You lend to a specific entrepreneur in the developing world - empowering them to lift themselves out of poverty.”20\n The Weberian ‘spirit of capitalism’, that is to say that the accumulation of wealth as an end in itself which is demonstrative of virtue, commitment, skill and stability on the part of the individual, now takes an electronically facilitated, and decidedly post-modern, global turn. For Weber, with wealth came responsibility to others: your wealth is God given, now do Gods work with it. The Kiva project enables people to short-circuit international development finance. Kiva has created an online marketplace for lenders and borrowers to come together, much like Zopa. Kiva facilitates person-to-person loans; the ‘disposable’ income of a (relatively) wealthy westerner loaned to an entrepreneur in the developing world. Kiva however is a radical departure from the trading of capital for interest; Kiva lenders are not loaning for profit, rather they are engaging in direct and global philanthropy. By choosing to loan on Kiva, someone is “sponsoring a business” to help the world’s working poor towards economic independence.\nThe Kiva marketplace lists the profiles and business plans of groups and individuals in the developing world in search of capital. Business plans are produced and reviewed by local activists and existing micro-credit organisations - Kiva.org calls them ‘field partners’21 - who are the critical on the ground link to entrepreneurs. These field partners work in support of the new or growing business, report back to investors and manage repayments.\nThis model significantly challenges the dominant development models of large-scale interventions, the legacy of which, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, should be a stain on the conscience of the developed world. Kiva is not, however, charity - these are loans and not gifts. The capital that changes hands is a strategic investment in entrepreneurial activity which the investor expects to be returned. As with Zopa, some sort of risk assessment is carried out, although not of the same manner of credit checking in the developed world. And, as Kiva’s website disclaims “Lending to the working poor through Kiva involves risk of principal loss. Kiva does not guarantee repayment nor do we offer a financial return on your loan.” That said, on $4,328,735 of loans with completed loan terms, the default rate is just 0.1%22\nInspired by the work of Muhammad Yunus23 and Amartya Sen,24 Kiva has grown from an activist project to one of the world’s largest microfinance peer-to-peer marketplaces, connecting entrepreneurs in the developing world to millions of dollars in loans from tens of thousands of lenders around the world. Kiva.org is helping the poor get access to credit. The relatively small-change from wealthy west is pooled and directly invested as micro-finance in entrepreneurial activity in the developing world. No banks, governments, agencies, nepotism nor corruption between lender and borrower. The amounts of money are small yet the positive effects on the lives of the world’s poor are great.\nHow scalable is the Kiva model? Globality and the inter-connectedness of our social existance are central to Kiva model. Kiva money is global in a way that Zopa is not - Kiva loans do not require ‘protection by the penal code’ in the way that mainstream debt does so Kiva money need know no borders. Yet, however great the significant change in the circumstances of borrower, Kiva money is micro-finance and does not yet scale to major community infrastructure projects.\nOn Philanthropy… Why are these peer-finance models successful? What is the attraction? These emerging models are, perhaps, representative of a ‘New Social Movement’ in economics, made possible by the wealth of the post-material and post-industrial developed ‘west.’25 With individual material needs to a greater or lesser degree satisfied, concerns beyond the material can develop; social and communitarian concerns. Zopa and Kiva have built on this growing holisticism, establishing participatory projects with philanthropic motivations. The mainstream corporate banking models I’ve discussed practice a ‘strategic’ philanthropy, expecting a return for their investment, whereas organisations like Kiva facilitate ‘altruistic’ philanthropy, characterised by the direction of funds, with Zopa sitting somewhere between these two poles.26\nCase Study: Open Capital  “The incorporation of Co-operative Principles gives us a Co-operative Corporate Partnership: this entity is capable of underpinning a truly Co-operative Society.”27\n Chris Cook’s model of ‘Open Capital’ demonstrates that participatory economic models can scale beyond that of Kiva to capital projects of a significant size. His models, based on using the legal status of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), represent a radical departure from other corporate or charitable forms. Open Capital is contrasted to the closed, often contradictory and antagonistic mode of capital in other incorporated bodies. The Limited Liability Partnership legal form allows for new modes of economic activity. In the Open Capital mode different economic actors become members of a legally defined grouping in order to pool their resources, meaning that members of an LLP are ‘on the same side’ – there is no ‘profit’ or ‘loss’ between the Members of a partnership, merely the creation, exchange and accumulation of economic value - in whatever form, be that resources ’to the value of’ money or indeed money, that members choose.\nOpen Capital attempts to solve a “paradox of the modern world: that humans have never been more inter-dependent in our needs, or more individualist in our outlook.”28 The two innovative concepts that characterise the Open Capital model are the alignment of interests of partners with other stakeholders and the use of proportional shares to a) represent value and b) constitute a form of capital, ‘Temporary Equity’ for use between partners. Chris Cook believes that the phenomenon described as ‘Temporary Equity’, which has the ability to raise capital without borrowing at interest, confers the emerging ‘Open Capital’ LLP model with a ‘property’ which may render it superior to others.\n A transaction entered into in 2002 by the Hilton Hotel Group serves as an example of how this ‘Temporary Equity’ may operate in practice. Hilton Hotel Group sold a portfolio of 10 hotels for some 350m GBP to an LLP in which Hilton (the Occupier) hold 40% and the balance of 60% is owned by another LLP linking the three Investor Members. For 27 years, investors receive 28.8% of the gross revenues from these hotels plus a further 33m GBP p.a., all subject to a floor of 317.5m GBP p.a. or 5%. Note firstly that there is no Debt and no Interest in this structure and the risks and rewards are shared as in all true partnerships. The outcome is therefore to create ‘Temporary Equity’ with a 27 year term. Most crucially, it is in the interests of both Occupiers and Investors to co-operate in order to create the maximum flow of revenue over the period of the agreement.29\n This Labour government’s flagship Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) have been criticised for enriching private interests at the expense of the tax-payer. These PPPs are based on ‘partnerships’ that are in reality ‘joint ventures’ in business transactions in which at least one of the partners holds a ’for-profit’, i.e. capital gain, motive. It is difficult for this author to see how the interests of government spending on civic services can be reconciled with the logic of private capital. As Ruth Sunderland comments, the “bailout of Metronet, which maintained nine tube lines, exposes the utter fiction that Public Private Partnerships and PFI projects transfer risk and debt away from the public sector.”30\nIn contrast to PPPs and PFIs, the Open Capital / Limited Liability Partnership model offers a possitive possibility for public capital projects of the scale of Metronet. This posibility is presented in the transcendence of both profit and loss by the positive step of the redefinition of these concepts. In a departure from the “competitive economy based upon shareholder value and unsustainable growth results from a transfer of risks outwards, and the transfer of reward inwards”31, Limited Liabilty Partnerships neutralise the conflict created by the centrifugal/centripedal strategy. In place of ‘profit’ and ‘loss’ are ‘risk’ and ‘reward’, as defined by all participants in the partnership to result in a mutually satisfactory exchange of value, rather than the simple exchange of capital. This has dramatic consequences for public spending. Firstly, money would have no “cost” when issued. Second, the ‘public’ does not need to borrow to invest. Thirdly, a “National Equity” formed from the value of the assets can be valued, as well as a National Debt.\nIn terms of socialbility, Open Capital configures co-operative relationships around the economic activity. Indeed, the social purpose of the economic activity is central to the LLP model. As a LLP organisation can be created without the involvement of solicitors or accountants it is certainly accessible to many different economic actors and different purposes. Chris Cooks gives a number of examples of sociable LLPs, from community land partnerships to the London 2012 Olympics, even private housing projects, on the Open Capital website.32\nTo what extent can capital be democratised? I am considering two aspects of democracy when evaluating the democratising potential of these peer-2-peer and social models. I am thinking of decision-making, in terms of transparency, governance and accountability, on the one hand and in terms of access to capital and credit services on the other.\nThinking in terms of control of decisions, Zopa is certainly democratizing capital. In terms of governance and accountability, Zopa’s radical transparency in all aspects of its business model and its openness in its use of online public forums are a marked departure from the private models of mainstream services. In the Social Futures Observatory33 survey of Zopa clients, 81% of lenders felt that Zopa offered them ‘significant’ control, whereas only 4% felt that mainstream financial services offered ‘significant’ control. Similarly, whilst 70% of borrowers felt that Zopa offered ‘significant’ control, only 1% thought that mainstream financial services offered ‘significant’ control. Zopa’s has a thriving community who participate in the online forums, offering peer-support to new-commers and seasoned members. Key members of the user community are regularly invited to meet with the Zopa team in person and have a voice in the development of the business. However the Zopa model does not ‘open up’ credit to a greater number of people, rather, it is an innovative alternative to the mainstream models.\nKiva, in contrast, is radically opening up access to capital. Micro-finance projects target the problem of access to credit and Kiva, through its use of the internet, is a very effective agency in co-ordinating this altruistic philanthropy.\nThe most promising hope for democratising capital is found in Open Capital and the co-operative society that this flexible and scalable model presents us with a glimpse of. Open Capital LLP enterprises can operate with charitable, voluntary, social and commercial aims and objectives. With Open Capital modes of economic activity, the social world is rescued from being subsumed by the economic world because relationships between the owners and the users of capital, however so defined, are no longer conditioned by interest and competition, but by value and co-operation.\nI began this paper with this challenge from Keith Hart…“What matters in the world is money, machines and people, in that order. Our political task is to reverse the order.”34 Zopa, Kiva and Open Capital are reordering our world, each in different ways. For Zopa, the rhetoric prioritises people, but people are not placed before money in practice: capital must be rented with interest. Kiva certainly prioritises people before money, then money before machines. The linking of a Kiva capital marketplace to fund infrastructure projects using the emergent phenomenon of Open Capital presents us, perhaps, with a model with does prioritise people, machines and money, in that order.\nBibliography Capra, Frank. 1947. “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Film.\nCattermole, Al. 2004. “UK Banks’ Write-Offs of Bad Debt.” Bank of England, Monetary \u0026amp; Financial Statistics, September. http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/ms/articles/artsep04.pdf.\nCommittee for Radical Diplomacy, The. 2007. “Speculating on Student Debt.” In Living in a Bubble, edited by Josephine Berry Slater, 24–31.

The text has provoked a critical examination of my own politics, bringing about a new consciousness of subject and sovereignty, of agency in a hyperglobalised world and of resistance to global capital. To a greater or lesser degree I do support Hardt and Negri’s contention that we now live in the age of Empire.\nTo justify my position of qualified agreement with these authors I will explore the following four broad themes that emerge from the work: global informational networked capitalism, of subject, sovereignty and supra-nationality, of biopolitical (re)production and of political agency for the authors’ subject of liberation, the multitude. This paper continues in three parts. I will first consider the economic order of Empire, examining the antagonism between the biopolitical and capital in global society. Secondly I will examine the post-modern reformulations of the modern political categories of state, subject and sovereignty. The third and final section of this paper is devoted to considering what hope there is for politics in the age of Empire.\nMichael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s post-modern narrative erects a theoretical scaffold capable of connecting with contemporary global neo-liberal capitalism. It is an attempt to break from the teleology of historical and materialist Marxisms, yet it is of a piece with Marxist theory in that it is a work of political economy. As every good Marxist will agree, the legal and political order of any given society serves the interests of the economic order in the same. To move beyond Marx, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri have drawn extensively on the work of Michel Foucault. It is Foucault’s reunion of social reproduction, in his terms the biopolitical, with the economic, i.e. material, base that provides the authors of Empire with a critical concept for their analysis. In Empire this concept is developed further, in order to engage with “the real dynamics of production in biopolitical society.”2 Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s conception of Empire articulates a global legal and political order serving the interests of global capital. Indeed, as they authors state, “[t]he first task of Empire, then, is to enlarge the realm of the consensuses that support its own power.”3 The key, global, concensus is that of global capital, for it is in capital that global networked relations are made and sustained.\nWith the description of the contemporary character of capitalism as informational, leading to immaterial production4 I am in agreement with the authors. ‘Communicative capitalism’5 and its perceived effects; the deterritorialisation, decentralisation and destabilisation of imperial power leading to Empire, is central to Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s argument. The great role of telecommunications and information technologies in the transition from material to immaterial production, from industrial production to knowledge production, can not be downplayed. Some authors, most noteably Panitch \u0026amp; Gindin have criticised this informationalist political economy for being based on relatively recent developments in computational power and fear that this approach exhibits a certain techno-determinism.6 Yet global communication networks need not be understood so uni-dimensionally. For Hardt \u0026amp; Nergi global communication networks are primarily social and symbolic before they are technical. “The communications industries integrate the imaginary and the symbolic within the biopolitical fabric, not merely putting them at the service of power but actually integrating them into its very functioning.”7\nHow are we to understand ‘the imaginary’? The role of images, the imagined, the imaginary in our contemporary global society, as described by Appadurai, is helpful here. For him ‘the imaginary’ is understood as “a constructed landscape of collective aspirations”8 and is crucial to understanding the dynamics of networked global flows of people, media, technology, money and ideology. Like the authors of Empire, although anticipating some of their thought by a few years, Appadurai also attempts to move beyond the essentialising epistemology of structuralist approaches to the social world. He argues that “the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (in the sense of both labour and culturally organized practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility.”9\nDescriptions of production under capitalism have frequently used biological metaphors. In the imperial age both colonial plantation labourers and urban industrial labourers were counted in units of ‘hands’. The informational economy continues this theme, now counting ‘heads’ or reckoning up ‘human capital’. From hands to headcounts the individual is masked by the depersonalising and homogenising units of capitalist calculation. Under contemporary informational capitalism it is not simply the brawn of a human that labours but the brain. The accelerated destruction of both Fordist, i.e. manual, repetitive labouring, and Taylorist, i.e. unthinking labouring, modes of production by communicative capitalism, that is to say the displacing of material labour with immaterial labour, has two consequences. Firstly labour becomes further abstracted, becoming labour power in general. Secondly, the previously hidden dimension of affective labour, the production and manipulation of human emotional states, now comes to the forground. This dimension is crucial as it is within the realm of affective labour that “social networks, forms of community”10 are produced and reproduced.\nThree types of immaterial labour are distinguished by Hardt \u0026amp; Negri. The emergence and growth of each are demonstrative of the passage to a post-modern global economy. These are the reshaped instances of industrial production which have embraced communication as their lifeblood; the ‘symbolic analysis and problem solving’ undertaken by knowledge workers, from a Chief Technical Officer to the first-tier of call-centre support; and affective labour, the creation and manipulation of emotional states, found above all within the service sector.11 Common across each of these labour types are social-interactions conditioned by cooperation rather than by competition, making cooperation “completely immanent to the laboring activity itself.”12\nThe post-workerist approach of Hardt \u0026amp; Negri forgrounds immaterial labour, yet clearly we are not living in an immaterial world.13 However it is very important to distinguish between different modes of labour and also to recognise previously ‘hidden’ labour, without which the ecosystem and infrastructure of contemporary global capital would not exist. The gendered and racist historical divisions of labour are two such examples of hidden productive labour. A second important face of the capitalist system exposed by immaterial labour is that of false class-consciousness and class-divisions. The concept of immaterial labour reunites knowledge and affective workers with the material, manual and industrial labourers of the world presenting the chance of an end to inter-class antagonism.\nThese changes at the level of the economy demand a new political theory of value formulated to reflect the networked production of wealth and social surpluses. These changes demand a new subjectivity, an ontology that reflects the networked co-operative interactivity of individuals.14 A new post-modern subjectivity will necessarily displace the modern conceptions of the same and will demand a rethinking of the related concept of sovereignty. Any post-modern reformulation of subjectivity and sovereignty must, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri argue, take into account the communicative nature of (re)production in a post-modern global economy.15 I now turn to the question of how the modern political categories of state, subject and sovereignty are transformed in the passage into Empire.\nBrowning, in his critique of Empire, notes that for Marx, human beings “are constituted by their social relations and capital capitalizes on this sociality by extending networks of relations across the globe.”16 Similarly, much of contemporary globalisation theory is formed from the linking of political economy to a wider web of social relations “to provide a comprehensive explanation of the present via wide-ranging synchronic and diachronic analyses” demonstrating an affinity with the grand narratives of Hegel and Marx. Empire replays many of the central motifs of globalisation theory, presenting a spatial-temporal reformulation of contemporary global society. Hardt \u0026amp; Negri argue that the hyper-global inter-networked interdependence of economic, political and legal structures diminishes the status of the nation-state. This has the effect of deterritorialising modern notions of sovereignty based on the concept of the nation-state. Therefore, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri argue, the modern realist paradigm of international relations is no longer adequate describe the actual global order. The persistant, stable duality of sovereign nation-states vis-a-vis an anarchic international arena had conditioned international relations, both theoretically and in terms of real politik, throughout the imperial age of history. Yet, in our contemporary world this duality is defunct, for all points on the political spectrum. The radical interconnectedness of global society demonstrates a degree of order, in contrast to the supposed anarchy, in the international arena. This is the point of departure for Hardt \u0026amp; Negri: the central “problematic of Empire is determined in the first place by one simple fact: that there is world order.”17\nIn Empire the “standard genealogies of modern sovereignty”18 are rewritten, addressing three specific problems with the ‘sovereignty narrative’. Firstly, agency is no longer state-centric, it is now immanent in the multitude. Second, the “intimate relation to racial subordination and colonization”19 crucial to the development of modern European conceptions of sovereignty is foregrounded, “challenging the militant Eurocentrism of the sovereignty narrative.”20 Thirdly, in rehabilitating the concept of ‘empire’ Hardt \u0026amp; Negri have debilitated the normalising tendency of the modern sovereignty narrative.\nHowever, as Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes argue, Hardt \u0026amp; Nergi’s symptoms of the passage from modern sovereignty to the imperial sovereignty of Empire exhibit a certain undertheorisation. These redefinitions are insufficient to fully displace the modern sovereignty narrative. Indeed, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri “remain indebted, both negatively and positively, to the sovereignty narrative.”21 Firstly, although the passage to the imperial model of Empire is not defined in “purely negative terms”22 the authors of Empire do have a negative dependency on the decline of modern political categories. Secondly, whilst the Eurocentrism of these modern political categories is weakened by the concept of Empire, the question of “what do we do about the United States”23 remains unsettled: this question is crucial to many criticisms of the passage to Empire and made all the more important in the light of US ‘imperialist’ military activity. That the US was instrumental in preparing the “political forms and terrain of Empire” and now “sits atop the imperial pyramid of power”24 that is Empire and yet is not the ‘new Rome’ is, for Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes, a contradictory and unsatisfactory conclusion, however precarious and temporary the position of hegemon in this new paradigm of sovereignty.\nAccording to Hardt \u0026amp; Negri, in “the passage from modern to postmodern and from imperialism to Empire there is progressively less distinction between inside and outside.”25 Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes respond with the criticism that Hardt \u0026amp; Negri have not paid “careful attention to the actual relations of rule through which European empires governed” at the expense of the “diverse relations not explicable in terms of the simple inside/outside logic of modern sovereignty.”26 In normalising Empire as the post-modern tendency that emerges from modern sovereignty, the former in effect legitmises the dubious constitution of the latter. Perhaps this is the case, but what is more important here, in the transformation of imperialism to Empire, is that the “modern dialectic of inside and outside has been replaced by a play of degrees and intensities, of hybridity and artificiality.”27\nThis debate between our authors and Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes essentially comes down to two differences. The first is in their different methodological approaches to theorising both the state and sovereignty. Empire is a post-structuralist autonomist reading of the state whereas Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes emphasise a more genealogical approach. A second difference is demonstrated in the authors different theoretical responses to globalisation. Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes strengthen the state through ‘internationalization’ as a response to globalisation. Hardt \u0026amp; Negri, in contrast, diminish the state to refrains of the Internationale.\nAt this point we should go back a little in order to understand the trajectory of the Two Europes, Two Modernities28 Hardt \u0026amp; Negri describe in Empire. The relationship between new paradigm of global sovereignty that is Empire and the global political subject, the multitude, is grounded in the history of struggle between capital and labour and intertwined with the growth of the nation-states of Europe as stable political entities. As Peter Green notes in his commentary The Passage from Imperialism to Empire, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri “repeatedly emphasise that the emergence of the nation-state system and ‘European modernity’ are inseparable from capitalism.”29 The relationship between labour, capital and state is theorised in Empire as a revolutionary/counterrevolutionary struggle. The revolutionary European modernity “destroys its relations with the past and declares the immanence of the new paradigm of world and life.”30 Hardt \u0026amp; Negri continue…\n “The new emergence, however, created a war. How could such a radical overturning not incite strong antagonism? How could this revolution not determine a counterrevolution? There was indeed a counterrevolution in the proper sense of the term: a cultural, philosophical, social, and political initiative that, since it could neither return to the past nor destroy the new forces, sought to dominate and expropriate the force of the emerging movements and dynamics”31\n The revolution of the multitude declares immanence the new paradigm of world and life. The counterrevolutionary modernity, serving the interests of the bourgeois “poses a transcendent constituted power against an immanent constituent power, order against desire.”32 That the transcendent constituted power of the nation-state is intimately and inextricably intertwined with capital is the principal reason for Hardt \u0026amp; Negri rejecting the ‘internationalisation of the state’ that Laffey \u0026amp; Weldes propose. Indeed, any anti-globalisation or anti-capital resistance “founded on the identities of social subjects or national or regional groups” tends towards the “localization of struggles” and is rejected by our authors.33 The lyrics of the Internationale expressed this sentiment long before Hardt \u0026amp; Negri:\n There are no supreme saviours, Neither God, nor Caesar, nor tribune; Producers, let us save ourselves, Decree the common welfare; That the thief return his plunder, That the spirit be pulled from its prison; Let us fan the forge ourselves, Strike the iron while it is hot; This is the final struggle, Let us stand together, and tomorrow; The Internationale, Will be the human race34\n The workerist hymn of the global proletariat becomes the post-workerist hymn of the global multitude through our authors’ conceptualisation and reconciliation of immaterial labour with material labour, uniting all biopolitical producers. Hardt \u0026amp; Negri recognise in the Internationale the radical response to the sovereignty of global capital: the end of the insider / outsider division of peoples, that which was enforced by the transcendent power of the nation-state, through a revolutionary humanism. As capital becomes increasing pervasive as a global force, so too must the subject of Empire, the multitude, respond, resist and realise its unity as a global force. Empire is the response, the counterrevolution, to proletarian internationalism.35 With the continued globalisation of capital and the structures of law that govern in its interest comes the possibility of further revolutionary change. The deterritorialization of modernity’s structures of exploitation and control is a positive benefit for the multitude, creating the conditions for further - final? - liberation.\nHardt and Negri’s hope for emancipation is found in the immanent power of the multitude, the agent with “the will to be against Empire.”36 The figure of the multitude displaces the Marxist subject of liberation, the proletariat, in the age of Empire through the connection of immaterial labour with material labour, thus uniting all biopolitical producers.\nBrowning is critical of Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s figure of the multitude.37He argues that the “emancipatory potential of the multitude, like that of the proletariat, is shaped by preceding diachronic conditions that have opened up the global possibilities of freedom, while Hardt and Negri maintain, like Marx, that the logic of emancipation precludes determination of the course of revolutionary action.”38 The critical question here is ‘what of the politics’? Browning highlights that the “unity amidst diversity that is characteristic of [E]mpire and its antagonist, the multitude, admits no clear mode of discrimination.”39 So what does resistance, or any sort of politics for that matter, look like in the age of Empire? Politics, social struggle, resistance - each require objectives as a basis for action. However, against the totality of Empire, as described by the authors, these objectives are made parochial, any strategy self-ghettoising. Is Empire anti-political as Laclau charges?40\nSchmitt’s expression of a modern conception of ‘the political’ is one of the purest.41 His friend / enemy distinction mirrors the inside / outside logic of modernity: each admits clear politically determined discrimination. For Marx, as Hardt \u0026amp; Negri remind us, “the relationship between the inside and the outside of capitalism’s development is completely determined in the dual standpoint of the proletariat, both inside and outside capital.”42 The relationship between the multitude and Empire appears to be a continuation of the dialectic between labour and capital. Yet, Hardt \u0026amp; Negri’s key argument is that the hyper-global inter-networked interdependence of people and of global capital has deterritorialised the boundaries of modernity. The radical variation in the universal unity of the multitude and of Empire forms a mesh of difference, a networked non-place - “the dialectic between productive forces and the system of domination no longer has a determinate place.”43 Remember, the “modern dialectic of inside and outside has been replaced by a play of degrees and intensities, of hybridity and artificiality.”44\nFor Laclau this is presents serious gaps in our authors’ argument. Firstly, the hybridity and artificiality of the multitude presents a “proliferation of a plurality of identities and points of rupture [making] the subjects of political action essentially unstable.”45 How are these subjects going to articulate action when they are radically unstable? A second criticism from Laclau is that the deterritorialization and virtualisation central to Empire undermines the political program, articulated as the rights and demands of the multitude, put forward by Hardt \u0026amp; Negri towards the end of the book. He writes that “both demands and rights have to be recognized, and the instance for whom that recognition is requested cannot be in a relation of total exteriority vis-a-vis the social claims.”46 The recognition of the rights of the multitude, the fulfillment of the demands of the multitude, the multitude becoming a political subject, each raise questions that Hardt \u0026amp; Negri do not adequately address in the book: the task of the multitude remains rather abstract.47\nReturning to the question of Hardt and Negri’s contention that we now live in the age of Empire. My position is that of a qualified agreement with the authors. With their description of a tendency towards the deterritorialisation, decentralisation and destabilisation of the sites and structures of power by the actions of both global capital and the multitude around a fulcrum of counterrevolution/revolution I am in agreement. This aspect of their argument, I find, is a compelling explanation of our present conjuncture. To this extent then I agree with our authors contention, demonstrated by various symptoms of a passage, of a tendency towards an age of Empire. What concerns me, leading to my qualified agreement, is that the relationship of subjugation between the multitude and Empire, and the possibility of the multitude’s liberation appears at the same time both overdetermined and undertheorised by Hardt \u0026amp; Negri.\nBibliography Appadurai, Arjun. 1996.

For the moment, please indulge me.\nMichael Walzner’s introductory remarks to his retrospective of communitarian criticisms of liberalism describes the brief but reoccurring lives of intellectual fashions.1 The initial intensity of the early communitarian critiques has subsided, a demonstration, perhaps, of the resilience of liberal political philosophy. Yet criticisms of liberal individualism resurface from old and new perspectives. This paper will consider the various arguments with liberal theory and liberal practice that communitarian critics hold. My view is that there are indeed a number of strong communitarian critiques of liberal individualism, critiques that are more than an expression of dissatisfaction by disaffected liberals. That said, like Walzner, I recognise the often contradictory relationship between different communitarian critiques. I also acknowledge that to a certain degree communitarian critiques are dependent on the liberal individual ontology, the very subject being criticised, to frame arguments. Yet I refute the assertion of Cohen who considers this “a deep contradiction in communitarian thought.”2 Furthermore, such communitarian critiques of liberalism are not framed constructively; that is to say, certain communitarian critiques do not have a better solution, only an clear sight of ‘the problem’ which I find both problematic and disappointing.\nThis is not, however, true of all communitarian critiques. The call to a virtuous, civic republican life from Alasdair MacIntyre3 will be considered, as will the radical democratic political theory of Chantel Mouffe who also draws somewhat similar conclusions, though from different premises, and in pursuit of different goals.4\nMy first task is to sketch an outline of the different communitarian critiques of liberal political theory. The reoccurring intellectual ‘fashion’ of ‘communitarian critiques’ has taken a number of different turns over the course of the 20th century. Liberalism and some of its critics exist symbiotically and the early communitarian criticisms, published in the 1970s, reflect this relationship.5 The grounds for these early communitarian critiques was epistemological. The twin threads of these critiques were the ontological basis of the liberal individual and the liberal individualistic morality.\nThe concern of thinkers critical of the ontological grounds of liberal theory is the primacy given to the individual over and above that of society.6 This ontology is highly individualistic; the liberal subject is liberated from social bonds that are seen as restrictive of freedom. This particular philosophy of the individual holds that membership of a community is not ascriptive of identity. The individual is primary and stands before the social order. This liberal individual is unconstrained, represented as egoistic and autonomous over the all decisions and actions that are part of the course of living one’s life. The epistemology of the liberal individual is if not chaotic, then certainly arbitrary. A communitarian critique of this liberal individual is concerned firstly with the isolated state that such an unconstrained being finds his or herself in and secondly with the disintegration of society that results from such atomised individuals. Yet against this charge of increasing entropy in the social world, the liberal ontology can account for the existence of the communities of association humans create and sustain for ourselves. The liberal individual recognises and chooses his or her membership of a community, their consent gives the association legitimacy.\nA communitarian critique of liberal morality centred in the individual is that this liberalism threatens the actual social order by its categories. Liberalism espouses freedom, yet it can not tell us what this freedom is for. The inheritance is rich when it comes to rejecting subjugation, fighting absolute and arbitrary power and in universalising freedoms. Yet liberal political theory is impoverished when it comes to describing what this freedom is for. The ‘zig-a-zig-ah’ of the Spice Girls, melts into air: they really, really want this ‘zig-a-zig-ah’ but its instrumentality, its utility to them can be neither questioned nor explained. Liberal individualism is criticised by communitarian’s for prizing something greatly yet not knowing its value. The communitarian critique has a valid point here.7 We, as liberal individuals, can not make discursive sense of our lives. This inability to give voice to the purpose of our lives tends, if not towards nihilism, but at least towards a precarious social existence. Liberal political theory can elaborate rationally the requirement of freedom, autonomy, \u0026amp;tc. Yet it falls silent when it comes to explaining what this liberty is for because of a rejection of any teleology.\nThe liberal individual examined by these preceding critiques is a philosophical figure. In contrast, the real lived lives of individuals in liberal societies are socially situated, context dependent and possessed not only of the formal freedoms of liberal theory but with families, communities and ties of association. Again the Spice Girls are helpful. The concert tour was cancelled for personal reasons, their zig-a-zig-ah now made secondary to their social ties.\nThe first two critiques presents liberalism as a triumphant failure, the first because it leads to the atomisation of society due to rampant individualism, the second becuase of the precarious existence these individuals live without a meaningful vocabulary to articulate their social bonds. Yet both of these critiques are in effect praising liberal individualism with their faint damns. These two critiques could be considered to be from those dissatisfied and disaffected with the consequences of the excesses of liberal individualism, not liberal individualism per se. Actual liberal societies are not as entropic as the first critique which is perhaps only highlighting “the truth about the asocial society that liberals create”8 Furthermore, the rejection of teleology by liberal theory, the problem for the second critique, does not extinguish other structures of meaning. The lived lives of individuals reflect the continuance of other socially situated structures of meaning and purpose, such as religious beliefs and political cultures outside of the liberal paradigm.\nHowever, as Walzer affirms, “each of [these] two critical arguments is partly right.”9 There has been a relative increase in dissociation and dislocation of individuals in liberal societies, as tracked by Walzer’s ‘Four Mobilities’. His observation feeds into what neighbouring socio-political theorists have described as the rise of a post-materialist culture which has contributed to the emergence of New Social Movements (NSM).10 Liberal political philosophy freed individuals (and capital, although that’s a different story…) from various social, political, marital and geographic bonds. These individuals, once free to act, pursued and realised significant improvements in their material existence. The first communitarian criticism, that of an atomised society of egotistical individuals, expresses a dissatisfaction with the theoretical liberal individual. Yet the contemporary liberal individual, with their material well-being assured, now develops concerns beyond the self. The growth of New Social Movements concerned with ecology and peace, two examples of undeniably social concerns beyond that of the egocentric liberal individual, demonstrates the sociability of individuals.\nNew Social Movements theories are built on the recognition of the historicity of individuals and the deeper social structure that liberal political theory denies in its ahistorical and autonomous individual. The perceived atomisation of society, and the rise of a post-material culture, at least in the developed west, has not dislocated each individual from their undeniably social roots. Individuals can talk to each other and make sense of each others lives. The growth of the memberships of different NSMs and the collaboration between such aggregations of communal interest, demonstrate an ability to share discursively experiences and to motivate individuals for shared goals.\nThe extent of NSM theories ability to account for the real stability and cohesion in society is limited. Multiple and fluid memberships of multiple associations and communities to not make a stable and coherent society. However strong the motivations of liberal individuals, their moral and ethical language is still in a state of lack when in comes to describing the purpose of the individual and that of the society created by such associations and groupings. When conflict arrises within these associations we are ill-equiped to resolve it.\nThe rejection of universal telos and morality in favour of a paradigm based on justice and universal rights as articulated by neo-Kantian libertarians such as Rawls11 and later Nozick12 is the grounds of a communitarian critique of liberalism from Sandel.13 This is a crucial criticism of the more contemporary liberal theory which considers liberalisms philosophical figures and its categories as substantially flawed. The claim that the rights of individuals must stand in priority over the common good of society has, explains Sandel, a “deep and powerful philosophical appeal.”14 Yet, as he goes on to demonstrate, the “failure” of its philosophical figure, the “unencumbered self”, and, indeed, the very claim of the priority of the rights of an individual over the common good of a community, has not prevented this vision of liberalism becoming “the one by which we live by.”15 Sandel shows that liberal justice and rights, while rhetorically universal, are, in fact, local and dependent on a community for recognition and meaning. He goes on to demolish Rawls’s ‘unencumbered self’: if liberal justice and rights can only have meaning within a specific community, then this community must first exist and second have ‘goods’ that it chooses to promote. Sandel’s communitarian argument of the priority of ‘goods’ over ‘rights’ withstands the libertarian counter-ordering.16 His is a deeper reading of liberal theory, one that uncovers the aporias in its individualistic philosophy, shaking liberalism to its very foundations.\nThis is a critique which has the ability to displace liberal political theory. Sandal’s critique of the modern refoundation of liberal theory by Rawls demonstrates the categorical abstraction required by liberal theory - the liberal individual is dispossessed of their individual unique attributes and separated from their nature, their social world, in order for liberal theory to have any purchase from its description. The abstraction of the individual and the social order in Rawls’ and Nozick’s work dislocates individuals from themselves, from the choices they make and the communities they form. This has serious consequences for politics, as Chantel Mouffe as made clear.17 What these neo-Kantians fail to recognise in demanding the priority of individual rights over the common good is that this “can only exist in a certain type of society with specific institutions and that it is a consequence of the democratic revolution.”18 That is to say that neo-Kantian liberals fail to recognise the historicity of liberalism, the context of the emergence of liberal political theory from the struggle against arbitrary and absolute authority.\nBefore continuing with Mouffe and her call for a reformulation of the communitarian critique of liberalism, I will consider one further critique of liberal political theory. The critique of liberal political theory, indeed of the whole Enlightenment project of which liberalism is the favoured off-spring, of Alasdair MacIntyre goes further than any other. MacIntyre’s criticism of liberalism is not a ‘communitarian’ critique for, as we have seen, such ‘critiques’ often only expressions of liberal dissatisfaction with the excesses of liberal individualism. MacIntyre argues that the political and moral standpoints which are typical of liberal modernity are the result of the failure of the ‘enlightenment project’ to establish a grounds for morality in either reason or feelings. The rejection of both transcendental and normative grounds by the ‘enlightened Moderns’ for their explanations of human nature is the cause of the decay and lack in contemporary liberal societies. Where the period we call the Enlightenment did accept normative grounds for morality and science, this was only in the sense that it gave primacy to the European world view of universal reason. For MacIntyre, the mistake of the theorists of modernity seeking to establish a rational and universal explanation of ‘human-nature-as-it-is’ was declining to comment on ‘human-nature-as-it-could-be-if-it-realized-its-telos.’19 MacIntyre argues that this is becuase they could not. These theorists have inherited only fragments of Ancient traditions and other social structures of purpose and meaning, left behind by the revolutions of the Enlightenment and early modernity so was not available to commented on. The rejection of telos meant the rejection of “the precepts of rational ethics as the means for the transition from one to the other.”20 This creates the moral problems of modernity, of the modern liberal individual and of liberal society. As MacIntyre writes,\n “On the one hand the individual moral agent, freed from hierarchy and teleology, conceives of himself and is conceived of by moral philosophers as sovereign in his moral authority. On the other hand the inherited, if partially transformed rules of morality have to be found some new status, deprived as they have been of their older teleological character and their even more ancient categorical character as expressions of an ultimately divine law.”21\n This, MacIntyre argues, tends either towards utilitarianism in the first example and, in the second, towards the ideas of those like Rawls, who, after Kant, attempt to establish universal grounds for ethical action in reason. Both attempts, says MacIntyre, “failed and fail.”22 He goes on to argue that it is not possible to prove universal and rational grounds as this rejects historicity, context and circumstance. MacIntyre is more Hegalisn than Kantian in this respect. There can be no presuppositionless rationality, just as there can be no ‘unencumbered self’. As for natural rights, or rights qua human, MacIntyre finds these concepts fictitious, fictions yet with “highly specific properties.”23 The purpose of these such idioms is to “at best provide a semblance of rationality for the modern political process, but not its reality.”24 The reality is a mock rationality which “conceals the arbitrariness of the will of power at work” in the political process.25\nMacIntyre posits that certain pre-enlightenment political traditions hold a shared moral \u0026amp; ethical language and recognises the boundaries of communities of understanding. This is a more complex approach than that of the authors of Habits of the Heart who recognised the presence of fragments of earlier moral languages in contemporary society. MacIntyre calls for a synthesis of an Aristotelian model of political activity with the ethics and morality of St Benedict; for us to retrace our steps, before the ‘enlightened’ turn which rejected human telos, and set out on our journey again. He urges us to establish “local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us.”26\nMacIntyre sees in the Ancients the nourishment that will remedy the lack at the heart of the Moderns. Yet I see no need for us to travel back with him in his attempt to revive classical political and ethical models. I am a liberal, a child of this age. I value the separation between the realms of morality and of politics that the enlightenment has bestowed on us. Yet I concede that this has led to an instrumentalist conception of politics, a politics devoid of ethics, and resulted in the normative concerns of the political subject, the liberal individual, relegated to the status mere values.\nSo what then of politics in our liberal age? Do we really have to choose between the liberty of the Ancients and the liberty of the Moderns? As Mouffe argues, “we should not accept a false dichotomy between individual liberty and rights”, i.e. the choice of the neo-Kantians, “or between civic activity and political community” as Sandal and, to a certain degree, MacIntyre would have us choose.27\n “Our choice is not only one between an aggregate of individuals without a common public concern and a pre-modern community organized around a single substantive idea of the common good. To envisage the modern democratic political community outside of this dichotomy is the crucial challenge.”28\n Perhaps Mouffe and MacIntyre are closer than I first thought. Perhaps his “local forms of community” are a manifestation of the radical democratic political community sought by Mouffe.29 While MacIntyre returns to a civic republicanism based on that of Athens, Mouffe posits a radical democratic citizen along the lines of an Oakeshotian respublica.30 The civic republicanism proposed by Mouffe is that of a radically democratic republic, built from but not returning to the Ancients, a republic with a decidedly post-modern character, which makes use of the “symbolic resources” of liberal political theory and the democratic tradition, rather than rejecting them.31 Whether this can be acheived without incoherance will perhaps be the subject of a revival for the intellectual tradition of ‘communitarian critique’.\nBibliography Bell, Daniel. 1996.

Firstly, Schmitt’s conception of the political draws our attention to the establishment and membership of a political community; who is outside our group, why, and what the relationship to outsiders is. Secondly, and most crucially, Schmitt reminds us that the methods of politics are contestable, that ‘the political’ is not bound within any manifestation of ideologies, institutions and mechanisms. I intend to show the significant relevance of Schmitt’s conception of ‘the political’ through my examination of these two challenges to contemporary politics.\nSchmitt’s definition of ‘the political’ is forceful due to its simplicity. His concept of ‘the political’ is the antithesis of friend and enemy. Schmitt’s friend/enemy dualism is a “definition in the sense of a criterion and not as an exhaustive definition or indicative of substantial content.”1 Crucially this antithesis is independent of other antithesis, such as moral, religious, rational, legal or economic antithesis. The use of the word friend is in its down to earth, literal sense. The meaning and therefore the identity of friend in this antithesis is easily understood. So while non-friends may appear immoral, heretical, irrational, illegal, or uneconomic these criterion would not be enough to distinguish these non-friends as ‘enemy’; indeed these are as likely to be characteristics of our ‘friends’, in Schmitt’s antithesis, as of our ‘enemies’. An enemy is separated from the union of friends; friends associate with one another and are dissociated from their enemies. The enemy is stranger, other, different, alien. Schmitt is not concerned here with private confrontations and competitions. Both friend and enemy are public. It is the public definition of friend and of enemy that makes this antagonism political. Schmitt’s Concept of the Political then is this antagonism, the “most intense and extreme antagonism …[becoming] that much more political the closer it approaches the most extreme point, that of the friend-enemy grouping.”2\nThe friend-enemy polemical criterion, as an antithesis independent of other distinctions, gives other political concepts meaning. By grouping with friends and identifying our enemy we can understand the political antagonism manifest between proponents of the state vis-a-vis society, between classes, between different manifestations of power as a state. Without the clarity of the friend-enemy grouping Schmitt demonstrates the “incomprehensibility” of these other political concepts. The friend-enemy distinction identifies “exactly who is to be affected, combated, refuted, or negated” in political language and in political actions.3\nThere are, as Schmitt points out, a variety of forms and degrees of intensity that the polemical nature of this antagonism could take.4 But in the extreme, decisive case, it is the state in its entirety, “as an organised political entity which declares the friend-enemy distinction.”5 The political for Schmitt is not is the administration of difference but the real and ever present possibility of conflict. At the ‘most extreme point’ the friend-enemy concept holds the possibility of violence. The enmity in this antithesis leaves ever open the real possibility of conflict for ones survival, the real possibility of killing enemy human beings. Political power, that utilised by the state in its declaration of enemy, is the ability to mobilise humans to kill other humans, in its most extreme case. Friend-enemy combat may be war with an enemy external to a political entity or a civil war with an internal enemy of a political entity. Schmitt friend-enemy criterion is not a metaphorical duality; it is a real grouping. Schmitt’s combat is equally real; war and civil war will involve the real “existential negation of the enemy.”6 The concept of war, like other political language, is given meaning by the friend-enemy distinction. War “presupposes that the political decision has already been taken as to who the enemy is.”7\nThis leaves us with a ‘chicken and egg’ confusion. If the friend-enemy dichotomy is the antithesis which gives other political concepts meaning, yet the final declaration of friend-enemy is held by an existing political entity, namely a state, what is the meaning of the state in Schmitt’s conception of the political? Schmitt is not interested in a general theory of the state8 in the same way as liberal political philosophy is, which, beginning with a narrative of inalienable rights arrives at a theory of state, constitutionally restrained by the people to govern for the people; or conceptions of the political similar to popular or democratic states. For Schmitt, the state is where the political is enacted; the state is the sovereign political entity, the only entity that holds the power over the decision which defines the identity of friend and enemy. “The concept of the state presupposes the concept of the political.”9 The empirical existence of nation-states, parliaments, liberal economies and democratic mechanisms is of no direct concern to Schmitt’s conception of the political; these concepts are functional because of the political, not conditions of the political in its self.\nThese concepts are the also the cause for Schmitt’s writing The Concept of the Political, The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy10, Political Theology11 and other texts. He is against conceptions of the political as understood through functional units such as state and society, against the political as parliamentary government, against liberal and democratic political conceptions: Schmitt is demanding that we recognise the political first, and in its self, before the prevailing political philosophy, institutions or constituent functions of a particular political community.\nAs noted earlier, Schmitt’s conception of ‘the political’ reminds us of two often neglected problems in political philosophy. Firstly, Schmitt’s conception of the political draws our attention to the establishing and membership of a political community through the friend-enemy antagonism. The establishing of a political community is, for Schmitt, a sort of Hobbesian escape from a ‘state of nature’, but in reverse. In order to know an enemy and to locate the threat of our own existential negation, humans create a political community. This explanation is not based on an anthropological or ahistorical proposition of either a negative or a positive conception of human nature in the former example, or in a constitutional framework based on liberal rights in the latter. Schmitt’s political community is Hegelian in that his political communities are transformed into being through the dialectical negation of what has gone before, rather than birthed, fully formed, as liberal narratives of the arrival of constitutionalism maintain. This transformational establishment of a political community illustrates the contingent and circumstantial nature of any political community, its functional appearance, and of its borders.12 Schmitt’s friend-enemy antithesis, his concept of the political, comes first: the definition of enemy defines the people in Hobbes’s state of nature, it defines with whom we are at war.\nUnderstood as this antagonism, the political is isolated from the institutions of government and the mechanisms of state. Has Schmitt successfully separated the political from political philosophy; from liberal conceptions of inalienable individual human rights and from democratic notions of popular sovereignty? In conceptualising the political as he did, Schmitt demonstrates that the methods of politics are contestable and that the political is not bound by ideologies, institutions and mechanisms. Here Schmitt is of significant contemporary relevance as his conception of the political, as distinct from political philosophy, ideology \u0026amp;tc, is made by a direct philosophical assault on both liberalism and democracy; two concepts, often conjoined by hypenation, which describe the culture and the practices of politics in many states today. Schmitt demonstrated what he perceived as an inherent instability in liberal democratic regimes and heralded the demise of parliamentary democracy. Although the increase of liberal-democratic regimes the world over since his writing may prove him wrong in empirical fact, his exposure of the necessarily consensual and antagonistic relationship between liberalism and democracy gives us the opportunity to glimpse at what lies behind the union of the liberal-democratic facade. Strauss and, later, Frye maintain that the principle recipient of criticism in Schmitt’s Concept of the Political is liberalism. Others, such as Cristi, view democracy as being the main target.\nTurning first to Schmitt’s engagement with democracy as it relates to his conception of the political. The circumstances contingent to Schmitt’s philosophical attack on democracy were that of Weimar period Germany and an apparent Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy.13 This ‘crisis’ was that brought about by popular involvement in politics through a democratically constituted parliament which weakened, in Schmitt’s view, the ability of the state to act, both in normative circumstances and most crucially in times of exception. Schmitt understood that democracy was a principle of legitimacy in a political order14 and was not suitable to be applied to day-to-day decisions of government. Most crucially, because the friend-enemy antagonism involves the real possibility of killing people it can not be decided democratically: enemies can not be declared by lottery. This is not to say that Schmitt is anti-democratic; Cristi demonstrates that Schmitt is advocating reform of parliamentarianism and maintaining democratic procedures in order to ensure the legitimacy of public officials.15 However, in order to preserve and protect the unity of the state, the purity of the political, Schmitt sought to restrain democracy.\nTo restrain democracy is to restrain the rule of the people over themselves. Democracy’s hegemony as a mechanism of legitimacy and of decision-making in political communities is evident; there appears a want for more democracy, not less. So what then can we learn from Schmitt’s engagement with democracy? There are three nuances to Schmitt’s understanding of democracy as it relates to his conception the political. Firstly the forging of the demos, the people in any democracy, is a crucial part of the conflict that the friend-enemy antithesis defines: this “paradigmatic constellation is a group’s contention of its ‘sameness’ and ‘identity’ against the ‘otherness’ of a different group.”16 This illustrates that democracy, or any institutional ordering, “rests on ‘the political’ as its preceding condition”17 and as such membership of a political community, that demos which is governed in a democracy, is also contingent on the friend-enemy antithesis. Second, democratic equality is always curtailed by the political. Democratic equality, the equality of humans beings with each other as humans, is a universalising conception of humanity; yet this is divided by friend-enemy antagonism. Only members of a political community can be equal, enemies can not. Third, Schmitt thought that democracy had been made functionally subservient to the liberal acceptance of social pluralism as an empirical fact. This reduced democracy to a decision-making mechanism, a rational way out of the multiple, equal and contending demands in politics.\nSchmitt’s concerns from Weimar period Germany articulate a precarious and contingent description of the democratic political ideal. The demos is shown as constituted through the political which defines the borders of who is to be treated equally, and who is unequal, ‘enemy’. With democracy bounded by the borders of a political community, its universal equality is revealed as being truly particular and unequal. This leads, in Schmitt’s analysis of his own political time, to a crisis of legitimacy, to partisan politics and the collapse of the liberal-democracy parliamentary political system. The question is therefore, what lessons can we take from Weimar period Germany for contemporary politics?\nChantel Mouffe18 engages with Schmitt’s contingent democracy, stabilising it, and teases out the challenges for contemporary democrats, liberals and civic republicans. Her close reading of Schmitt redeploys some of his arguments against him and in support of political ideas that he would not have supported. I will briefly outline some of her challenges to democracy derived from Schmitt, particularly community homogeneity and contingent closure.\nSchmitt is interested in the ‘sameness’ of a political community. In highlighting his desire for homogeneity at the price of heterogeneity, Mouffe describes two ways in which community homogeneity is problematic. Firstly when ideas of nation and national identity are attached to the state creating the nation-state and secondly when citizens are detached from the state, creating a cosmopolitan stateless global citizen. In the first case, membership of a political community can become dependent on meeting criterion defined by identity politics stemming from realms which are non-political in Schmitt’s conception. Nazi ideas of a pure Aryan nation should be sufficient a warning against politics based on a non-political criterion. In the second case an example of contemporary relevance is revealed. A post-modern conception of membership of a global political community emerges, one without spatial location. Mouffe evaluates the viability of a cosmopolitan global democracy negatively: “We should indeed be aware that without a demos to which they belong, [these] cosmopolitan citizen pilgrims would in fact have lost their democratic rights of law-making. They would be left, at best, with their liberal rights of appealing to transnational courts to defend their individual rights when they have been violated.”19\nAs I have shown, Schmitt’s conception of democracy and democratic equality is specific and could never scale to encompass the whole of humanity. Democracy, like Schmitt’s concept of the political, is understood as an antithesis: the democratic principle of equality must have the necessary correlate of inequality in order for the whole concept to have meaning. Furthermore, democracy can only be understood as a political concept because of the political, the friend-enemy antithesis. Schmitt’s central concept in democracy is not ‘humanity’ but ‘the people’. Consequently democracy can exist only within a political community; democracy can exist only for a people.20 For Mouffe, this is the necessary contingent closure of democracy: the paradoxical closure of democratic equality to anyone outside of the political community, outside of the people who are friends, demonstrates the inequitable nature of democratic equality.\nI have already outlined that Schmitt viewed the state, the embodiment of a political community, as being under attack on two fronts; on the one hand by the popular sovereignty espoused by democrats, on the other hand by that of liberal philosophy, limiting the state by constitutionalism. I will now turn to Schmitt’s engagement with liberal philosophy as it relates to his conception of the political. Schmitt’s interpretation of liberal thought distinguished between its ethical and economic strands:\n “…liberal concepts typically move between ethics intellectuality and economics trade. From this polarity they attempt to annihilate the political as a domain of conquering power and repression. The concept of private law serves as a lever and the notion of private property forms the centre of the globle, whose poles - ethics and economics - are only the contrasting emissions from this central point.”21\n Neither strand can be understood as ‘political’ in Schmitt’s terms. Ethical liberalism prizes the liberty of the individual, economic liberalism defends the autonomy of the economic sphere. Schmitt is clear that on the question of “whether a specific political idea can be derived from the pure and consequential concept of individualistic liberalism”, this much is to be denied.22\nEthical liberal thought, in Schmitt’s view, weakened the ability of the state to act both in normative circumstances and, most crucially, in times of exception. This was due to two factors: constitutionalism and pluralism. The state was weakened by constitutional restraints on the scope of government. These constitutionally defined limits are public and delineate the boundaries of normal state action. Here we see a challenge to the sovereignty of a political community. The moment of exception is by definition outside of normative circumstances, i.e. those predefined by a constitution. This means that when faced with an exceptional circumstance the liberal state is incapable of acting to defend its self.\nThe second aspect of Schmitt’s criticism of liberalism is its philosophical weakness when dealing with the empirical fact of a plurality of interest groupings in society. The existence of different social groups and civil associations, i.e. pluralism as a fact, is not a direct challenge to Schmitt’s concept of the political. These groupings are outside of the political. Indeed by Schmitt’s analysis these various social and civil interest groups each possess the capacity to transform themselves in to political communities and do so the moment that they can make the sovereign demand of killing and being killed of their members as a result of the decision in the exception. What is problematic in liberalism’s acceptance of ‘pluralism as a fact’ is that it tends towards conflict negation through rational consensus, i.e. democracy. Democracy is used to escape the problematic in pluralism. Democracy is accepted by liberals as a rational decision-making mechanism, manufacturing unity where none could exist. Mouffe criticises liberal governmental rationality for Foucaultian ‘governmentality’ on this basis.\nWhile ethical liberalism may masquerade as a political philosophy, economic liberalism is certainly not a political philosophy. That notwithstanding, economic criteria, that is to say antithesis from the economic sphere such as economic/uneconomic, can escape out of the private realm and into politics, reducing the political to mere competition and diluting government down to the technocratic administration of transactions.\nLeo Strauss in his Notes on the Concept of the Political23 confidently asserts that Schmitt’s thesis is “entirely dependent upon the polemic against liberalism”. Charles Frye agrees that The Concept of the Political and much of Schmitt’s other work seeks to demolish liberalism.24 Renalto Cristi, while on the one hand acknowledging Schmitt’s assault on liberalism, rejects the primacy given to this aspect of his thought by Strauss and Frye. Cristi argues that Schmitt “came to realise the genuinely apolitical nature of liberalism. He now understood that its pluralist demands need not be conjoined with the democratic ideals. Liberalism is not a political imperative and so its pluralist demands may be restricted to the social sphere.”25\nGiven historical fact it would be easy to dismiss the erstwile Nazi Schmitt’s ideas as having no relevance to contemporary politics. He was an conservative thinker writing about the specific circumstances of Weimar period Germany with a disdain for both liberal and democratic politics. His desire was to reinvent some form of absolute sovereignty, his purpose was to rescue Germany from modernity. He could be portrayed through a surface reading of his work as having little to say that is helpful for contemporary politics. Yet Schmitt needs to be understood in terms of his place in a lineage of political thought; from Hobbes’ state of nature, through Kantian absolute monarchy to Hegal’s aristocratic Prince. These thinkers of the enlightenment period were each treading the pathway between the twin poles of authority and liberty, a journey that leaves no pilgrim unscathed. Their ideas were brought forward by the dialectical negation of what had gone before. Greater and wider demands for individual liberty vis-a-vis political authority caused these thinkers and others to examine the nature of the liberty of the individual and the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state. It was the demise of monarchical sovereignty, its replacement with aristocracy and the laters later negation and succession by liberal parliamentary democracy which fueled Schmitt’s conservative desire for the reestablishment of authoritarian markers of certainty. With this transformation in mind we can understand Schmitt’s Conception of the Political and other texts not as heralding the collapse of the ‘non-viable’ liberal democratic regime, but as a moment in the dialectical negation of liberal democratic forms. In engaging with the themes and problems of liberty and democracy as described by Schmitt, Mouffe et al26 are continuing this dialectic.\nSo what to take from and what to leave with Schmitt? Firstly, Schmitt’s conception of the political draws our attention to the establishment and membership of a political community. Secondly, and most crucially in my view, Schmitt reminds us that the nature of our contemporary political communities, that is states which are liberal and democratic, is contestable. That ‘the political’ in its essence is not bound by any other concepts.\nSchmitt’s contemporary relevance is in demonstrating that we must always remain open to group redefinition and that this definition is a political one, not racial, social, economic, moral \u0026amp;tc. There can be no political community and therefore no order without first defining outsiders. There can be no politics without this basic antagonism. Contemporary political activity continues the rhetorical performance of this distinction.27\nThere is a postmodern view of Schmitt which makes use of his criticism of liberalism and democracy. This view holds that contemporary liberal democracy lacks debate over common values, its only common value being that it values all values equally and apolitically. However the continued empirical fact of incommensurable differences between peoples which creates conflict runs contrary to the liberal democratic narrative and the presuppositions in its twin claims of a securing rational unity and b that there can be no politics without consensus. Schmitt shows that consensus is irrational. Consensus stifles argument and negates rational unity, the very goal of liberals throughout the Enlightenment. Schmitt is also used to defend the value of argument and by demonstrating that the political is found in antagonism he reminds us that politics is as much about what we don’t want as it is an arena for getting what we do want.\nThe threat of conflict remains although in our twenty-first century multicultural global society it is no greater than any fear the nineteenth century Schmitt may have felt. Conflicts continue to break out due to the destabilisation of the friend-enemy distinction. Yet violence does not have to be the outcome of this conflict. However there will be violence because it has never not happened this way. The acceptance of the certainty of conflict is a key lesson to take from Schmitt. One need not share his anthropological pessimism with regard to the nature of human beings in order to recognise this certainty.\nIn his book on of the relationship between liberalism and democracy Norberto Bobbio demonstrates that the old liberal Friedrich von Hayek, like the conservative Schmitt, acknowledged the distinctiveness of liberal and democratic doctrines28 There was once utility in the conjoining of liberalism and democracy and that was in the struggles against monarchical absolutism. Yet the time for this hypenation has past. Schmitt teaches contemporary politics that liberalism and democracy are two solutions to two different problems. The former with governmental functioning, the latter with who is to govern and by what procedures. This reminds us that the nature of our contemporary political communities, the consensus on liberal democratic forms, is contestable and temporal. Strauss’s Notes… reinforce Schmitt’s point about the inviability of liberal democratic regimes and the desirability of replacing them with regimes that recognise conflict rather than negate the political.29\nMouffe’s reconception of the friend-enemy antithesis as adversaries, that is, as friendly-enemies, builds on Schmitt’s conception of the political.30 She conceives of an agonistic plurality of adversaries, acting in a shared symbolic space. Both liberal and democratic ideas are grounded in an individualistic conception of society and this is reflected in their competition for the same symbolic space. Can the agonism in the meeting of liberalism and democracy lead us towards a viable union of ethical liberalism and democracy, on to new conceptions of liberal pluralism and of democratic equality? For Mouffe this is possible and desirable. The liberty of the individual and the self-rule of a community are of equal importance and are reflected in her agonistic conception of the political.\nBibliography Bobbio, Norberto. 2005.

When Marcus and I started this project, we knew that blending by NHS \u0026amp; Ubuntu together we\u0026rsquo;d a) quickly explain exactly what the thing was; b) be likely to get in trouble with Canonical or the DoH. And so it came to pass that Canonical were totally fine with the remix and the DoH were not.\nMarcus has posted more details in his post - NHSbuntu Name Change\n\nWorking with us. We\u0026rsquo;ve had several big names in open source get in touch with us.\nCanonical approached us after the El Reg article. We\u0026rsquo;ve discussed becoming an Official Ubuntu Flavour and using the Canonical tools to make our lives easier and the build faster.\nRedHat have also been in touch recently. Talking with them has made us think about becoming a cross-distribution project. Watch this space!\nCisco invited us to collaborate in a healthcare \u0026lsquo;alternative desktop\u0026rsquo; demonstrator. This could lead to a significant pilot in at an NHS Trust. Fingers crossed!\nHashicorp are getting behind us, supporting us with sponsorship and access to the cloud services they offer. We\u0026rsquo;ve been using Vagrant and Packer in creating NHSbuntu, so support from them is most welcome.\nChocolatey are also getting involved. Hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to offer an official N3 hosted package repository for applications widely used on MS desktops in the NHS.\n\nWhat’s coming up.

It’s time we talked about something. NHSland has a problem. A debt problem. A technical debt problem of immense proportions. We’re friends. We can talk about this. Openly. We want to help.\nBeveridge identified Five ‘Giant Evils’. We’ve also identified five giants. Five giant factors that compound the technical debt in NHSland: Security, Legacy, Speed, Cost, Freedom. Beveridge’s work was instrumental in establishing the NHS. And we love the NHS. We want to help the NHS deal with these giants and end the downward spiral deeper into technical debt.\nGiant 1 : Security. The ‘NHS’ must have 70m+ patient records, 1.2m employees, a 1m or so desktops, countless more indirect users from third parties, thousands of locations, and a spaghetti of interconnected infrastructures. This would be a significant challenge within a single enterprise; when distributed around the many individual organisations that make up the NHS the challenge is gargantuan.\nGiant 2 : Legacy. We know you’ve still got Windows XP running. And just as soon as a majority finish migrating to Windows 7, Microsoft end mainstream support for it. Oh, and Windows 10 mainstream support ends in 2020, just about the time you\u0026rsquo;ve all gone paperless\u0026hellip; And then there are the applications prescribed by The Centre that must be deployed, each with its own dependency on a Java version long since retired, each with a specific browser version that conflicts with another. Each update released comes with fear and loathing.\nGiant 3 : Speed. Medicine is fast; responsive and agile. NHS tech is slow; reactive and cumbersome. Modern software development leverages browser technologies and network services to rapidly get functions and features to users, while in NHSland cascading roll-outs of fat desktop applications remains the norm. Shortening the tech life-cycle and increasing the pace of delivery are aims that we’ve been hearing from Innovation Accelerator Challenge Award Competitions for years. There won’t be any Fast Followers when there are only Slow Leaders.\nGiant 4 : Cost. Typing, font changing, saving, attaching, sending, receiving, tracking changes, Replying To All, shared calendars, instant messaging, meeting invitations, chat, video conferencing: these are common functions of commodity software. There are several ‘feature comparable’ office applications on the market, with prices ranging from £FREE to £000’s. Why pay for one software package when a comparable and compatible alternative can be used for free?\nSomeone recently told us the license cost per-seat for disk encryption software. For 1300 or so machines, spreading the costs over a 5 year subscription for affordability, licenses were £12 each. That\u0026rsquo;s around £15,000. At one organisation. The numbers bleed into zeros when the charge for over the whole NHS is considered. For software capability that could be acquired for £nothing.\nGiant 5 : Freedom. The legacy dependencies, ever present security challenges, increasingly frustrated and dissatisfied users, costs spiralling in direct proportion with the reduction in finances. These factors restrict customers and vendors alike. We want to help the NHS break free from these constraints.\nWhy NHSbuntu? To provide tech that is Secure, Modern, Fast and Free to the NHS.\nAnd slay giants.\n","href":"/2017/03/27/why-nhsbuntu/","title":"Why NHSbuntu?"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/neova-health/","title":"Neova Health"},{"content":"Here is a sneek peek at a presentation I shared with the Neova dev team recently.

In this post I\u0026rsquo;m looking at the role of governance and community around open source projects.\nFollowing the Safer Hospitals, Safer Wards Technology Fund announced in June of this year, Gary McAllister posted a comment piece which neatly summarises key criteria of open source which I paraphrase here:\n The code should be freely available online, well-documented and accessible. It should be evident from the code repository that regular commits are made to the project from multiple sources, demonstrating that the code-base is active. The licensing for the code should utilise an \u0026ldquo;Open\u0026rdquo; license. Examples of licenses which meet the Open Source Initiative definition of open source can be seen here. A project should have corporate investment and a viable service provider clearly backing the product. This may sound counter intuitive but in order for an Open solution to be viable long-term it needs backing from a corporate entity. Without corporate backing the solution is \u0026ldquo;unsupported\u0026rdquo; and there is little evidence to ensure continued development. You could end up with a stale loaf of bread.  These are good criteria and should be foremost in the mind of NHS-E, HSCIC and other healthcare organisations when considering procuring solutions based on open source software or engaging in an open source software project as a development or domain expert partner or when releasing code developed in house to the wider healthcare economy.\nAs mentioned in my last post, none of this is particularily new to HSCIC, or rather, CfH as was then. The eHealthOpenSource KTP project run out of CfH, Data Standards and Products and the Department of Health Informatics Directorate covered much of this ground in its few years of live. There are several pieces published on the eHos website by the project team which over in detail licensing and development approaches As an industry partner of the eHos KTP, Tactix4 supported the establishing of a code forge for CfH and NHS organisation code. See http://forge.tactix4.net/gf/ The forge won a award for innovation from the NHS Innovation Centre and the Cabinet Office, not for its technology but for the initiative of supporting the publishing of code and for its part in helping to sustain a active developer community. After initial pump priming, it was envisaged that eHealthOpenSource would evolve into an independent and self-sustaining organisation. This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened as I outlined before, however the forge lives on and code continues to be committed by NHS organisations including HSCIC and Leeds Teaching Hospital. While eHos was somewhat successful in fulfilling criteria 1 and 2, it did not evolve into providing a corporate investment role although viable service providers around open source solutions have emerged.\nRisk. After much leaning on encouragement to open source its PICS, it has been announced that University Hospitals Birmingham will offer its Prescribing Information and Communication System to the NHS not as open source but on a licence-free basis via some sort of escrow mechanism.\n The trust’s medical director, Dr Dave Rosser, told EHI that Birmingham would not be offering its PICS e-prescribing system open source because it is too risky. “We think open sourcing PICS would be dangerous. It’s too complicated a programme with very complicated code,” said Dr Rosser. “It would be risky to say the least. It has 600,000 lines of code and it is all interactive. It’s very easy to make a change in one part that changes something in another part that not even the programmers can predict.”\n I feel that this mode of releasing software will actually undermine policy objectives (as previously discussed) and does a disservice to healthcare technology (open or otherwise\u0026hellip;.). Software needs governance and assurance. Escrowing code does not deliver these. This mode of publishing code gives nothing beyond a pile of soft spaghetti to the NHS: this is not a comment on the PICS solution which we know works for UHB \u0026hellip; and while I\u0026rsquo;m not advocating a partial-\u0026gt;full re-factor of this obviously successful code base either, in order for others to adopt and deploy assurances are needed in the forms of:\n Community. meaningful ways in which others can participate in the development (technical, functional, social, etc) of the project; Testing. unit tests, code coverage and continuous deployment of the base to help with regression/development testing; Documentation. you know, that stuff that tells people how it works; Governance. an organisation (and I use the term loosely) that will assure, for example, ISB0129/0160 practices in place.  There are not small beer tasks. These four aspects are the sort of roles that OSEHRA perform for the VistA community and that the Apache Software Foundation perform for larger opensource projects. You can see how Apache incubate and onboard projects and codebases here. Without the above four, then yes it is too risky for another organisation to adopt and implement the code, open source licensed or otherwise.\nGovernance. Where NHS-E have been discussing open source the role of corporate investment and of viable service partners to support and sustain such solutions has come up. EHI report this as \u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;the government will put in place safe guards in form of a custodial structure\u0026hellip;to ensure that the open source software is used safely.\u0026rsquo; To my mind, the reporting of open source in this way by EHI muddies the water. To use any software safely in a clinical environment the Information Standards Board has published ISB0129 and ISB0160 which cover the responsibilities on the supplier/developer of a software product and on the procuring/implementing organisation respectively. The full title of ISB 0129 is \u0026ldquo;Clinical Risk Management: its Application in the Manufacture of Health IT Systems\u0026rdquo;. This guidance pertains to any software development where the intended use is a clinical setting, regardless of the license model that the code is published under. Also covering software development is the EU Medical Device Directive. The certification process is clear and it applies across Europe. This presentation from Dr Neil Ebenezer at Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency gives a great overview to developing software for a clinical setting.\nBack to Birmingham - EHI Live, not UHB - again where Beverley Bryant told reporters:\n “What we propose is to create a structure of custodians,” adding “We haven’t finished the work in terms of the detail.”\n Now, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at the key-notes given by Bryant or Kelsey or others from NHS-E as I was either presenting at HANDI Health or in the Open Source Skunkworks.\nCommunity? Interested! In my session in the HANDI Health conference stream I illustrated an exemplar structure for a custodian organisation around open source projects. I advocated the use of Community Interest Companies to \u0026lsquo;own\u0026rsquo; the code and to manage the governance of an open source project. This approach would be in line with the Foundation model around Apache or the OSEHRA organisation around VistA. I am not advocating one-organisation-to-rule-them-all and all the bloat and anti-innovation that comes with it; nor am I advocating a wild-west free-for-all. I advocate playing-nicely-with-others.\n A Community Interest Company (CIC) is a limited company, with special additional features, created for the use of people who want to conduct a business or other activity for community benefit, and not purely for private advantage.\n My full slides from the HANDI Health event have already been posted to Slideshare and I\u0026rsquo;ve blogged about the session here.\nI advocate CICs for a few reasons, mainly:\n Obvious Community - NHS Organisations! Shared Interests - in using IT to deliver clinical and business functions to staff; Runs just like a Company - to help with the Cabinet Office / BIS agendas in support of UK Plc, SME, Wealth creation etc.  Here is a simple example of a CIC organisation for an open source project:\n  Still with me at the back? Here is a more complex model showing how a CIC might operate as a business: managing partner relationships, releasing software, assuring regulatory compliance, \u0026amp;tc.\n  This sort of approach would also work for an over-aching governance \u0026amp; assurance model for NHS-England / HSCIC to adopt. We could think of an NHS-E-CIC as a Big Tent in which a variety of organisations could become members and actively participate in the governance and assurance of healthcare IT in general while at the same time leaving individual projects to decide for themselves appropriate approaches to the same.\nIdeally we end up with something like this \u0026hellip; only in pink.\nTactix4 are establishing a number of Community Interest Companies around the various open source projects that we are working in right now. There will announcements on the T4 website in due course.\n","href":"/2013/11/14/community-and-governance/","title":"Community and Governance"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/hscic/","title":"HSCIC"},{"content":"There have been several announcements from NHS England / HSCIC in support of open source solutions for NHS organisations. These announcements have spawned much discussion and debate - on EHI/HSJ/NHSHackday sites and at EHILive - which ranges in style and content from Chicken Licken to Richard Stallman.\nIn a short series of blogs I\u0026rsquo;m planning to post I\u0026rsquo;m going to look at these announcements and the reaction from a few different perspectives. In this post I\u0026rsquo;m looking at where the direction for such support from NHS England is coming from and what \u0026lsquo;support\u0026rsquo; for open source solutions might actually mean.\nDirection towards for open source comes from the Cabinet Office and also Department for Business Innovation \u0026amp; Skills as demonstrated here:\n “The days of the mega IT contracts are over, we will need you to rethink the way you approach projects, making them smaller, off the shelf and open source where possible.” Francis Maude MP, Minister for the Cabinet Office, 2nd December 2010. (cited, PDF)\n   \u0026ldquo;Government Open Source policy is a commitment to ensuring a level playing field for open source and proprietary software.\u0026rdquo; Francis Maude MP, Minister for the Cabinet Office, Memorandum answering questions submitted by the Public Administration Select Committee (PDF) for the Cabinet Office evidence session on 30th of March 2011.\n The goal from BIS is to level the playing field, ensuring that public sector procurements are not unfairly (or anti-competitively) excluding any licensing mode or preferring one business model over another due to a lack of understanding or lack of knowledge of how to procure on the part of the buying organisation. So we can understand NHS-E / HSCIC\u0026rsquo;s announcements as being fully in line with Cabinet Office policy; good thing for NHS-E / HSCIC \u0026hellip; the Cabinet Office appear to have to double stamp any procurement or funding over a fiver these days and being in line with policy goes some way to getting the first of those stamps.\nThe Cabinet Office published an Open Source Procurement Toolkit back in 2011 the purpose of it is to ensure that there is a level playing field for open source and proprietary software. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that if P came before O in the alphabet it would read \u0026lsquo;a level playing field for proprietary and open source software\u0026rsquo;. Intellect have done much supplier engagement work with NHS-E and HSCIC on helping to shape and share government policy around open source - I\u0026rsquo;ve been to several such events.\nNone of this is particularly new to HSCIC, or rather, CfH as was then. Starting back in 2009 (!) eHealthOpenSource was a KTP project which served as an ‘engine’ to lift-off an \u0026lsquo;ecosystem\u0026rsquo;. CfH Data Standards and Products and the Department of Health Informatics Directorate contributed a number of products and services to the eHealthOpenSource community. After initial pump priming, it was envisaged that eHealthOpenSource would evolve into an independent and self-sustaining organisation. This didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. Mainly due to a rather messy end-of-project transfer phase and also due to the churn of the re-organisation of various health informatics and technology services bodies. There are lots of great resource on the eHos website and its well worth a rummage.\nFast forward from 2009-11 to 2013. The Safer Hospitals, Safer Wards Technology Fund announced in June make specific references to open source, helping to \u0026lsquo;level the playing field\u0026rsquo; and educate procuring organisations about such solutions. Complicating the debate was the inclusion of some sort of NHS VistA in the Tech Fund bid. EHI editor Jon Hoeksma posted a long op-ed piece about NHS England\u0026rsquo;s thoughts of committing millions of pounds to a UK version of a US open source electronic record system. A good number of sessions at EHI Live this year also covered technology strategy, including open source approaches. Where as previously such sessions would have been more on the fringe on the exhibition, in Birmingham earlier this month key-note addresses covered the opportunities and approaches for Trusts in this area.\nAll the above demonstrates that NHS-E \u0026amp; HSCIC are becoming an educated and informed purchaser of information technology services in line with Cabinet Office policy and are, at the same time, disseminating knowledge to the other public sector organisations it interacts with.\nSince the closing of Tech Fund round 1 NHS-E have indicated that up to £20m of the \u0026lsquo;Safer Hospitals, Safer Wards: Technology Fund\u0026rsquo; will go towards open source projects - or to put that in perspective for Chicken Licken and Richard Stallman 4% of the Fund. A recently published draft of The Health and Social Care Information Centre strategy for 2013-2015 presented at the centre\u0026rsquo;s latest board meeting says it will extend its support for NHS organisations and providers using open source technology to increase integration across health and social care. I can understand why too. Over the summer information was published about a skunk-works project to build an NHS Spine replacement using open source and agile methodologies by Leeds-based BJSS. Full PDF here. This National Infrastructure will need support services over its life-cycle and with other aspects of National Infratructure heading in the same direction (HES, CnB, etc) this need becomes more pressing.\nFrom the strategy paper:\n \u0026ldquo;Extend our support for local health and care organisations in their use of Open Source software, especially for their Electronic Patient Records;\u0026rdquo;  Translation: We support some license based software procurement models, why not others?   \u0026ldquo;Review the implications of the extended use of Open Source for the HSCIC’s own business model, regarding the ongoing management and development of the national services it manages;\u0026rdquo;  Translation: We\u0026rsquo;ve rebuilt Spine with open source technologies \u0026hellip; how do we support and maintain it?   \u0026ldquo;We work collaboratively with the market so that we can work to support the new requirements, particularly in regard to the use of Open Source software and the development and use of Application Programming Interfaces.\u0026rdquo;  Translation: There must be more developers out there that can build us new features, but how do we procure skilled domain specific services? And all the cool kids have got APIs these days to make it easy to flow data \u0026hellip; how do we get these interfaces built to H\u0026amp;SC information systems?    As I wrote in EHI, the real story for health IT from this HSCIC briefing paper is the changes to commercial relationships envisaged (page 21).\n\u0026ldquo;Our future relationship with the market involves:\n Contracts with smaller financial values, covering shorter duration; Significant reductions in procurement timescales; Increasing use of Government frameworks; New approaches to engaging and driving the market, with particular emphasis on engaging with Small to Medium Enterprises and creating competitive market tensions not only during procurement, but throughout the delivery of a service; Less reliance on multi-national operators acting as prime contractors; Where possible leveraging services from other Government departments.\u0026rdquo;  From everything I can see from NHS-E and HSCIC they are fully in line with Cabinet Office policy and contemporary service procurement approaches and are levelling the playing field, all the while exploiting the opportunities of each to the benefit of the public purse and UK Tech Plc. Most importantly NHS-E and HSCIC are taking a strong position on educating procuring organisations with the skills and techniques to be an informed an savvy consumer of IT and services in line Treasury and Nicholson economics: Do More With Less.\n","href":"/2013/11/12/levelling-the-playing-field-and-educating-the-customer/","title":"Levelling the playing field and educating the customer"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/nhs-england/","title":"NHS England"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/policy/","title":"Policy"},{"content":"Presented to the HANDI Health Apps conference at EHILive 2013 and continuing my series of provocative and disruptive anti-presentations here I talk about approaches to developing, distributing and deploying software solutions in social systems.

HANDI were producing one of the streams at this exhibition \u0026lsquo;The HANDI Health Apps Conference\u0026rsquo;. HANDI Health Apps is the first national conference dedicated to health \u0026amp; social care apps and lightweight digital tools to take place in the UK. It was a “must attend” event for app developers, health and care professionals, managers and commissioners who are seeking to understand how this new generation of digital tools can support the delivery of efficient, patient centred care. The conference included the HANDI-App Village located right in the centre of the EHI Live Exhibition providing a unique platform where health and care app developers can showcase their products without getting lost amongst the large stands of the major IT vendors.\nAnd we had a village pub, serving real beer and excellent pork scratchings.\nI thought it was a good idea to \u0026lsquo;live code\u0026rsquo; an app. In hind sight it was a good idea to \u0026lsquo;live code\u0026rsquo; an app and, except for the failure of the internet link, it would have worked well. Thankfully, as a child of Blue Peter, I had an app that I had made earlier prepared and ready installed on my device. With this APK file I was able to demo an app that scanned a barcode containing a URL and launch a browser. Here is the APK and here is the QR code.\n\u0026lsquo;Nice barcode - now what?\u0026rsquo; I decided to code a simple barcode scanning app using freely available open source tools. The goal was to produce something simple that scanned a barcode (QR or GS1) and then opened a browser with the URL in the barcode. This would provide a base framework for a scan-\u0026gt;web page app.\nI decided to do the demo from my Linux Mint laptop. You could do all this on Windows or on a Mac. Instructions can be found all over the internet. You\u0026rsquo;d need an Apple machine to make an app for an iDevice.\nKit list:  Node.js and the Node Package Manager Cordova : a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript. Combined with a UI framework such as jQuery Mobile or Dojo Mobile or Sencha Touch, this allows a smartphone app to be developed with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Phonegap is a free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for the platforms you care about. (developed by Adobe, now called Cordova and curated by Apache Foundation) Barcode scanner plugin from Scandit (but you could use BarCodeScanner plugin from @wildabeast who is one of the original phonegap developers) InAppBrowser plugin I also needed to install the Android Developer Tools and the Sun Java Development Kit  Method: I decided to leave as out of scope the installation of the JDK and ADT dependencies. These are extensively covered here. I also left as out of scope covering installing node.js and NPM (the node package manager).\nFrom the command line, I installed cordova \u0026amp; plugman using npm\nsudo npm install plugman I then created a new cordova project and added android platform features\ncordova create ehiscan1 com.example.ehiscan1 EHIScan1 cordova platform add android I downloaded the scandit plugin and unzipped it before installing it with plugman\nplugman install --platform android --project /home/robdyke/Development/ehiscan1/platforms/android/ --plugin /home/robdyke/Downloads/scandit/ plugman install --platform android --project /home/robdyke/Development/ehiscan1/ --plugin org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser Write some code: Now to edit the index.html file to load the barcode scanner and perform an action on the input.

If PPACA wasn\u0026rsquo;t communist enough! Writing in Bloomberg Businessweek, Paul Ford explains that the debacle known as healthcare.gov makes clear that it is time for government to change the way it delivers IT: embrace the open source approach to software development that has revolutionized the technology industry. Well, openness worked before for Obama e.g. with the IT spending dashboard (code here) but that was in the first years of the first term. You can do anything in that period of a presidency.\nLooking at the Congressional hearing (which makes our PAC look rather tame on NPfIT) as reported by Grauniad two lessons stand out for me. One technical, the other political.\nFrom a technical perspective the importance of proving an end-to-end test FIRST and not two weeks prior to a go-live is crucial. This is the approach we are taking with Wardware and the other projects we are working on. Can we pass a simple message through the components of the stack? No. Fix it. And now? Yes. Great! Build on and test for regressions.\nFrom a political perspective, it looks like this project was deliberately frustrated and suffered from a generally hostile atmosphere in Washington surrounding the ACA. This all but guaranteed that healthCare.gov would be late, broken, or both: \u0026ldquo;As late as the last week of September, officials were still changing features of the Web site.\u0026rdquo; reports the Guardian. Many government IT projects, particularly ones that are created as the result of specific legislation - Choose and Book any one? the NHS Spine ensemble? - require the construction of an entirely new infrastructure. New needs careful planning, development, implementation and testing. It will break under the weight of continuous interruption and feature-creep. healthcare.gov was practically strangled by politicians \u0026hellip; the same people that are now apportioning blame via the helpful method of circular firing squad.\nThen a week or so ago the single-point-of-failure did just that.\n  Over on Arstechnica Sean Gallagher gives his view on Obamacare site\u0026rsquo;s litany of woes in a piece \u0026lsquo;The seven deadly sins of HealthCare.gov\u0026rsquo;: Hyper-complexity, Dependency issues, All-new build, Rolling requirements, Anti-testing, Release late \u0026amp; release once, Anti-bugfixing.\nThankfully NHS England \u0026amp; HSCIC are not looking like going down the same path - one previously well trod by UK Govt IT.

Sure, I run Tactix4 which provides services and support for opensource solutions to the NHS but I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in plenty more these past 24 months which have shaped policy, practice and procurement of technology for healthcare IT in the UK.\nIn his nomination, Ewan Davis of Woodcote Consulting wrote:\n As a tireless advocate of a open approach to building a sustainable digital health economy and has a significant influence over the thinking in the sector I think that Rob Dyke is someone who would use the accolade of becoming Healthcare IT champion to further promote the vital developments of which he\u0026rsquo;s been such a vocal proponent.\n The importance of open data, open systems, open standards and open source is being increasingly recognised by the NHS and this is no small part a result of pioneering work I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked hard, both within the context of my work at Tactix4 and my voluntary efforts with a number of organisations, to promote the importance of all the players in the health IT Market place “learning to play nicely together” if the NHS is to realise the social and economic benefits from the digitisation of health and care.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve championed the role of open source and open standards in creating and sustaining a vibrant market, while recognising the place of proprietary solutions as part of a mixed economy in the digital health ecosystem. I\u0026rsquo;ve stressed the importance of building sustainable business models around open solutions, demonstrating this with Tactix4\u0026rsquo;s delivery of the open source bedside monitor software Wardware to a number of NHS trusts, developing an approach that ensures value for the NHS and a commercial return for our company from which others can learn.\nI\u0026rsquo;m generous in sharing my learning with others and has played a leading role in the open source and apps movements. As a founding Director of HANDI Health a not-for-profit company set up in 2012 to support app developers in health and care I\u0026rsquo;ve given much time and other resources to help establish HANDI as a leading voice in the sector.\nAs one of the founders of OpenGPSoC another not-for-profit venture established to develop and promote open source solutions for UK General Practice and my public facing and behind the scenes work with OpenGPSoC I\u0026rsquo;ve been influential in shaping the recently announced GPSoC 2 procurement which will provide open interfaces through a much more open commercial framework for those wishing to compete or interoperate with the existing GP suppliers.\nTactix4 have been active supporters of the NHS Hackdays and EHI Skunkworks with sponsorship and participation in both initiatives and have supported the BCS PHCSG in its exploration of new ways of working with digital health technology.\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to stand up and promote views in relation to openness in an uncompromising fashion; often views which are not popular and sometimes to my personal and commercial disadvantage, however this voice continues to promote these ideas vigorously, ideas which are now becoming mainstream.\n","href":"/2013/06/27/ehi-healthcare-it-champion-2013/","title":"EHI Healthcare IT Champion 2013"},{"content":"From \u0026ldquo;Berkshire bigboy 2e2 in the pink - apart from crushing debt burden\u0026rdquo; (29th June 2012) and \u0026ldquo;Integrator-reseller 2e2 \u0026lsquo;broke banking covenant\u0026rsquo;, hits credit buffers\u0026rdquo; (9th Jan 2013) leading to \u0026ldquo;UK\u0026rsquo;s 2e2 goes titsup\u0026rdquo; (29th Jan 2013 ) those following 2e2 will have seen the writing on the wall.\n2e2 released a statement to eHealth Insider saying the company had a, “strong underlying business” and remained “highly focussed upon our NHS and health customers which are core to our vision. We have not missed any bank interest payment and the interest that we actually have to pay is smaller than the total interest that has been cited in the past,” the spokesman said.\nCan 2e2 be trusted anymore? The spokesperson says \u0026ldquo;We have not missed any bank interest payment and the interest that we actually have to pay is smaller than the total interest that has been cited in the past\u0026rdquo; yet \u0026ldquo;[2e2s] liquidity issues came to prominence in 2012 when two County Court Judgments were issued to 2e2 over late payments of debts: one for £14,000 in September and one for nearly £40,000 in June.\u0026rdquo;\nAccording to El Reg\n \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;staff running IT services at Sussex Partnership NHS Trust (SPNT) to down tools. SPNT signed a seven-year outsourcing contract with 2e2 in April that was worth 5m in its first year and 36.8m in total - the largest job on 2e2\u0026rsquo;s books. Contacts close to the 40 bods working on that NHS contract told us this morning that contractors and permanent 2e2 employees still had not been paid despite assurance from FTI. \u0026ldquo;The programme director was on site and a couple of desktop [services] people, only a handful,\u0026rdquo; said one well-placed source. \u0026ldquo;The administrator has failed in its commitment to the trust to provide continuity of service and people,\u0026rdquo; claimed another.\u0026rdquo;\n What will happen in my back yard (NHS North Central London Cluster) and for the other Trusts using 2e2?\nAs Oliver Huitson writes on openDemocracy / ourNHS: \u0026ldquo;Markets rely on failure. But for health services \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; can be literally fatal.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;As Services 2e2 provide to London PCTs were previously done in-house but outsourced some years ago, according to a staff member. More details will surely emerge over the coming days but if the picture is accurate it highlights once again the dangers of mixing markets - and failure - with essential public services. When Railtrack failed - the ill-fated private owner of Britain\u0026rsquo;s rail network - it had to be renationalised after scores of people lost their lives in three major crashes.\nThere are also concerns over the loss of skills and institutional capabilities when services are outsourced, the state\u0026rsquo;s operational memory is not infinite and after prolonged periods it can be difficult and expensive to bring services back in-house.\u0026rdquo;\n More from El Reg:\n \u0026ldquo;2e2 grew at an accelerated rate through multiple acquisitions and almost wholly on borrowed money. It paid over £50m to acquire Compel and followed that with its acquisition of Morse Group in 2010, a business at the time of similar size to 2e2, paying a little over £70m. Its initial forays attracted Duke Street Capital and then Hutton Collins at around the time of the Morse acquisition. But 2e2 has not made a pre-tax profit for many years. In the last five years to December 2011, its accumulated pre-tax losses amount to around £135m. Its interest payments over the same five-year period totalled some £145m. Operating profit declined from £11m in 2009 to £7m in 2010 and finally £2m in 2011 - this despite increases in revenue each year given acquisitions. There is no escaping the fact that 2e2\u0026rsquo;s UK biz was essentially a \u0026ldquo;zombie\u0026rdquo;, one of a legion of businesses saddled by enormous unsustainable debt and whose profits were simply unable to cope with interest payments. Sure, some interest payments may not actually be payable until the VCs take their final bow, but who in their right mind will look at the accumulated value of rising debt and take it on?\u0026rdquo;\n Blame 2e2! Blame the NHS organisation! Blame the workers! Next thing people will be blaming Gordon Brown, The ash cloud, Giant vampire squids or the wrong type of snow\u0026hellip;.. Any which way the market is clearly broken for any business model that depends on leveraged debt for operational expenditure; from South London Trusts to Managed Service providers\u0026hellip;. It\u0026rsquo;s broken further still by contractual relationships that are over many years, closely linked with dead costs of licenses and dependent on further abstraction of relationships between the \u0026lsquo;business\u0026rsquo; and the IT organisation. When clinician, technician and PM functions can work closely together they can create and deliver meaningful digital services; when everything is managed via a service desk to a subcontracted third party the ties are too weak, leading to low quality outputs.\n  Well, that\u0026rsquo;s my 2e2p worth anyway\u0026hellip;.\n","href":"/2013/02/10/berkshire-bigboy-2e2/","title":"Berkshire bigboy 2e2"},{"content":"This week I went to a supplier engagement event led by people from the Government Digital Services on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board.

I helped a few other with their hacking too, including @amcunningham and @simon_penny who created Muto network.\nWe thought that as online appointment booking and using video for clinical consultations are so QIPPing hot right now with the NHS Commissioning Board and the Department of Health Tech Office falling over themselves to encourage the use of Skype for Doctor/Patient consultations and being loudly evangelical about appointment booking we ought to hack something for that.\nOur view was that the use of Skype in healthcare has a few problems - it requires installs of software and a Microsoft account\u0026hellip; And what about recording the consultation for \u0026lsquo;training and quality purposes\u0026rsquo; or maybe embedding the video in the into the clinical record? These things are not possible with the current technologies the NHS uses (Skype, Cisco webex). Additionally video meeting software is not very \u0026lsquo;accessible\u0026rsquo;; the tech usually excludes people who make use of screenreaders or other tech to make the interwebs accessible to them. Online booking is not widely adopted even though the GP systems and add-on products widely support this function.\nOur hackday project enables browser based video consultations that are easily booked by a patient. We have tried to build a solution that would work with the established processes in a practice too, with the work flow of booking an appointment for an in-person consultation replicated for the video consultation.\nChoose and book: A patient chooses an appointment time from a list of slots published by the practice; the practice receptionist/administrator acknowledges and books the appointment; the clinician (Doctor / Practice Nurse) then holds the video consultation.\nThe consultation can include document sharing - e.g. for images of scans or PDFs of test results - as well as screensharing to allow for the clinical system to be viewed too. Additionally the entire conference can be recorded with the video stored for later retrieval by the patient and the clinician. We could even send the whole file as a coded-CDA document using NHS integration standards to another clinical system The opensource software we have used has lots of functions to support people with those specific accessibility needs needs.\nThere is still work to do on the project which we will continue in our 20% time over the coming weeks.\n","href":"/2013/01/28/nhshackday-3-video-consultations-for-healthcare/","title":"NHSHackday 3 - Video consultations for healthcare"},{"content":"\u0026lt;li class=\u0026quot;photonic-flickr-image photonic-flickr-photo photonic-pad-photos\u0026quot;\u0026gt;

My presentation is published on slideshare and previewed below.\nDick writes:\n Possibly the most disruptive speaker was Rob Dyke of Handi (Health Apps Network for Development and Innovation), who helps clinicians to write apps. He is scornful about \u0026ldquo;big IT\u0026rdquo; in healthcare. First, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well. It costs billions, and, worst of all, does not talk to other big-IT systems. Handi\u0026rsquo;s apps, he claimed, are open-source, and consequently do work together.\n Thanks for moniker Dick, I\u0026rsquo;ll get some new business cards printed.\n More disruptively, he believes that an \u0026ldquo;Institute of Innovation\u0026rdquo; is the ultimate oxymoron, because \u0026ldquo;you cannot institutionalise innovation\u0026rdquo;. Instead you have to \u0026ldquo;be agile, hack things together, funnel ideas, forge solutions, tweet about them, blog about them; fail lots, win some\u0026rdquo;.\n While I must thank Roy Lilley of NHSManagers.net for the ultimate oxymoron line, the message still stands. Of the all the speakers, I at least gave some opportunities for innovative practice and the real networks for innovation in healthcare IT as found in HANDI Health.\n In my book, the Handi approach to innovation, although piecemeal and informal, is more likely to change the culture of the NHS than Sir David\u0026rsquo;s stately institutions for innovation.\n HANDI Health has this culture change at heart, Dick.

Neither of these solutions allows ready access to the information in a digital form, and does not provide any of the benefits of digital capture.\nThe Solution: By creating a general-purpose question asking android app we have removed the need for the paper part of the process, now the questions are displayed on the screen and the results are captured digitally. It is no longer possible to write something that is illegible, or answers a numerical question with letters, or forget to answer certain questions. The results are then sent securely to the server where they are stored and can be forwarded directly to the appropriate system for further use.\nIn addition to the app, there is a web based front end that can be used to generate new surveys, add scoring systems to weight the questions or branching for handling nested questions or if/then type interactions. This simple to use system is suitable for anyone to use, and can very quickly create a replacement for virtually any paper-based questionnaire or form.\nFeatures\n Easy to use web site for creating survey Support for scoring of answers, e.g. Waterlow score.

Lots of great projects curated by enthusiastic people, encouraging new thinking around the definition, development design and delivery of technology for healthcare. Here I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about DigiHealthCon, HANDI, NHS Hack Day and the eHealthOpenSource competition and Pipe and Hat Club. I\u0026rsquo;m involved in three organisations: eHealth OpenSource as Secretary, HANDI as a co-founder and NHS Hack Day as a participant and advocate. When I\u0026rsquo;m not doing things relating to those three, I\u0026rsquo;m a Director of Tactix4 Limited, an opensource healthcare IT company. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share some of my thinking about these projects and how I see them fitting together.\neHealthOpenSource is a long standing grouping of industry, healthcare orgs and academics born out of CfH. It\u0026rsquo;s going through a reboot right now as a supplier / advocacy / support organisation. It\u0026rsquo;s mission statement is:\n To support open source deployment in the NHS and UK healthcare by:\n monitoring and promoting the use of open source software nominating appropriate open source suppliers for ICT tenders developing and encouraging best practice in open source software acquisition   eHealthOpenSource will support and further the adoption of CAOS (Complete Adoption of Open Source) healthcare. It is a stimulant on the supply-side by supporting and networking open source projects, companies and consultants.\nHANDI is a new Community Interest Company, a not-for-profit organisation, formed to further the \u0026lsquo;app paradigm\u0026rsquo; in healthcare IT. The \u0026lsquo;app paradigm\u0026rsquo; is the antithesis of Big Bang, Rip and Replace, One System To Rule Them All. HANDI is a stimulant on the demand side. By facilitating networking between healthcare organisations at events where messages of agile and openness are strongly advocated by experienced practitioners, HANDI encourages a wide variety of people and organisations to challenge and change both technology and procurement practices towards better healthcare IT. HANDI also lobbies government, quangos and trade bodies in support new entrants into healthcare IT by advocating the HANDI vision of stacks, platforms and openness. Through openness and through stacks and platforms, the much discussed \u0026lsquo;healthcare apps\u0026rsquo; to connect-all, in terms of patients, records, services, can flourish.\nNHS HackDay has a number of aims. These are:\n  To have fun, this is an opportunity for bright doctors, developers, and designers to meet and learn from people in other disciplines they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally meet To make software that promotes health, this is the challenge and there are prizes, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait and see what this is To showcase the benefits of open source software, open governance, open data, challenges, and the talent in the SME software development community   NHSHackDay highlights the art of the possible. I am immensely impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment Carl et al have for radical alternatives to traditional healthcare IT. For me, NHS HackDay sits somewhere between supply and demand. On the one hand, NHS HackDay makes stuff by bringing together developers and clinicians to hack solutions to areas of market failure in healthcare IT. By crowdsourcing problems and peer producing code to address them, NHS Hack Day has shown the art of the possible. On the other hand, NHS Hack Day also stimulates demand. By encouraging the open discussion of healthcare IT failures and sign posting solutions from the open source world, or those hacked at the events, healthcare professionals and managers can demand better IT from Shared Service organisations, internal IT or systems vendors.\nI want to see each of these three organisations continue to flourish and grow. I see that each has a distinct raison d\u0026rsquo;etre and different modus operandi. To my mind, wherever possible these three organisations need to support each other as the commonalities in the vision for healthcare IT are great. I don\u0026rsquo;t see any competition, only complementary and extremely beneficial overlap.\nI know that Carl Reynolds, Ewan Davis, and Malcolm Newbury (of IHE and eHos) are each advocating new paradigms to the various organisations that have the ability to influence healthcare IT procurement from the top. By meeting with DH, the Cabinet Office, Intellect, BCS Health and others, NHS Hack Day, HANDI and eHos are giving voice and advocating the messages of openness and agile for the NHS. Through openness and agile NHS IT can realise better value, greater user (clinician, patient, administration) satisfaction, longevity of service.\n","href":"/2012/07/06/a-few-notes-on-the-enthusiasm-around-healthcare-it/","title":"A few notes on the enthusiasm around healthcare IT"},{"content":"I participated in the first NHS Hackday last month. The weekend event in central London brought together doctors, healthcare leaders and software developers with the aim of creating solutions to problems experienced on a daily basis in the NHS.\nThe winning development, called ‘Patient List’, aimed to improve the handover of patients and replace the traditional task-list methods usually employed by doctors.\nThe Patient List problem is felt by every junior doctor in the NHS, but it was formally raised by Wai Keong Wong in a blog post titled \u0026ldquo;Give every doctor an extra 30mins/day with patients by solving the ‘Patient List’ problem\u0026rdquo;. In summary, a system is needed to save junior doctors from error-prone manual daily work compiling lists of patients and their treatments for their daily rounds. Furthermore, the system should include task lists for each patient and a way to manage transfer of tasks between shifts and departments so that nothing gets forgotten during handover.\nI worked on a solution using HL7 data to populate a database. A dummy data set of patients, admissions, wards and consultants was reused from an open source project Wardware. NewContext and ValueDecision teamed up with Dr Colin Brown at the Hack Day to develop a solution.

Apps become the technological expressions of the \u0026lsquo;quantified self\u0026rsquo; of the developers - \u0026ldquo;Homogenous teams of innovators make products for people just like them. And that\u0026rsquo;s a problem.\u0026rdquo;\nPerhaps this \u0026lsquo;quantified self\u0026rsquo; analysis misses for the point, for not just the old and cynical but for the vast majority of the population : \u0026ldquo;After all, we build what we know.\u0026rdquo;\nYet there is a grain of truth here. It is probably easier to build an app that helps a specific group of people from within that group. If you are a COPD patient you are probably in a strong position to help other COPD patients than other outside that cohort, or if you have never been to a doctor with a problem\u0026hellip;. Similarly it is easier to build a GP system if you are a GP. True, but perhaps this inside/outside logic is diminished by contemporary software development tools and techniques.\nSo what is the problem with the some of the current rash of \u0026lsquo;health\u0026rsquo; apps, particularly from the US? These apps are not really for patients at all but for the \u0026lsquo;curious well\u0026rsquo; or already well-motivated. They also give the false impression that we can somehow engineer ourselves into life-long good health.\nMore here on the Future of Self-Tracking including this comment.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a case of “not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” The self-monitoring movement is jut another manifestation of our profound self-absorption. When you measure something, presumably you have to react to it. Is the hope that this constant self-monitoring will change our behavior? My guess is that it will simply generate revenue and speaking opportunities for its aficionados and compost, but have little impact on public health. Just look at how decades of focus on diets and weight have fared. In fact, it feels to me that this fixation on blow-by-blow narrative of our “health” is quite the opposite of what real health looks like. Oh, well, call me a luddite! \u0026quot;\nOf course this is only a small segment of what might be covered by HANDI but it is currently very fashionable in the US and may distract govt and other funding sources from more useful approaches. \u0026ldquo;Innovate for a population who needs it \u0026hellip; . This will require non-traditional business approaches, and willingness on the part of entrepreneurs and innovators to work directly with incumbents, be those pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies, hospitals, or government agencies to inject productivity into the system through technology.\u0026rdquo;\nThis much was agreed by those in the discussion group. Which is why one thought it was important to actually understand the needs of specific patients, more than patients in general, especially those with chronic illnesses or long term contions. Not only do they need the greatest care, it is perhaps them that seeks to benefit most.\nWith thanks to Tim Benson, Wai Keong Wong, Ian McNicoll.\n","href":"/2012/03/23/a-problem-with-mhealth-apps..../","title":"A problem with mHealth apps...."},{"content":"","href":"/tags/apps/","title":"Apps"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/nhs/","title":"NHS"},{"content":"\nA single corporate identity for the NHS was introduced in 1999.

The solution has been voted up to progress from \u0026lsquo;Buzz\u0026rsquo; stage to \u0026lsquo;Teaming\u0026rsquo; stage.\nAs part of the incubation process for solutions, DotGovLabs have engaged the support of Experts from Departments of state and the Private Sector to give feedback and pose challenging questions to teams. This weekend David Ostler, Chairman of unitedHealth posted feedback on our solution and several others. I thought I would repost the exchange here.\nDavid Ostler: \u0026ldquo;What are the reasons why open source adoption has lagged. Been around for a long time. Why hasn\u0026rsquo;t it taken off - seems like it should be more widespread than it currently is. Must be reasons why? What are they?\u0026quot;\nRob Dyke: \u0026ldquo;Hi David, thank you for your questions. I\u0026rsquo;ll make some answers specifically around NHS/Public Sector IT, before looking at open source more widely.\nI think that the Cabinet Office identified the reasons for the lagging of open source software in its recent ICT strategy document: the playing field is not level. Two significant factors skew the market.\nFirst, the trend towards ever greater outsourcing has diminished the \u0026lsquo;intelligent customer\u0026rsquo; capacity in the public sector, leading to procurement by tender using risk based assessment models. This inherently favours proprietary software from corporations with the resources to hedge the risk. It matters not whether iSoft deliver what they are contracted to do if there are commercial mechanisms of compensation and insurance to protect all parties. When the relationship between a no longer \u0026lsquo;intelligent\u0026rsquo; Customer and BIG IT Service Provider is asymmetrical, a DoH/iSoft outcome is guaranteed.\nThe second factor is one of scale. There was for some time - and still is, in many respects - a desire for BIG IT. Capital I, Capital T projects would deliver all singing, all dancing, pervasive, unified processing environments for all transactions the Secretary of State for Department of X could dream of. This again favours proprietary software from corporations with the resources to speculate on a tendering process where the financial rewards are great. Although why proprietary software should be favoured by public sector procurement is a mystery to me. It would make more sense for the public sector to be an equal owner of any intellectual property created, at least until delivery (see this Register article from 2005; six years on \u0026lsquo;moral hazard\u0026rsquo; is still a crucial question for the DoH CfH NPfIT relationship with CSC, iSoft and BT.).\nThese two themes were consistently and repeatedly given in evidence to the Parliamentary Public Administration Select Committee on \u0026lsquo;Good Governance: The Effective use of IT\u0026rsquo; and were central to the argument in the Institute for Government\u0026rsquo;s recent report \u0026lsquo;Fixing the flaws in government IT\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Cabinet Office have set out the operating framework for public sector IT in the Strategy published this last week: more Open Source and no more BIG IT. The strategy is welcome, however I will wait for some of the goals to be achieved before loudly heralding in a new era.\nLooking more widely than public sector \u0026amp; NHS IT, the adoption of open source and open standards has been the crucial factor in the growth of internet. From the protocols driving the networking layer, to the standards enabling the presentation layer, open standards, especially those embodied in open source software have scaled to the immense size of the internet. Open source software is used on more webservers than closed source alternatives, as the NetCraft \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo;s that site running\u0026rsquo; survey shows us month in, month out.\nThere are many talented development teams in local information and infrastructure teams across the NHS. Supporting this great pool of talent with tools like the collaboration / development forge proposed in this Solution will support the Govt ICT Strategy from the Cabinet Office.\u0026rdquo;\nDavid Ostler: \u0026ldquo;Completely agree with the comment about open standards. These are required in a public utility like health care. (my opinion is that the NHS does this better than most health systems).\nI still can\u0026rsquo;t figure out why open source is used less than you think it ought to - I am not an expert there. But in the for profit world I live in, if I can use open source to drive down my cost of development, I have complete incentive to use it, It is lower cost - and I either increase my profit or have a lower price which means I win the bid. We do use it, but not close enough to the decision making to know when and why we chose to use it. I am sure we consider availabity of skill sets, scalability, supportability and total cost of ownership.\u0026quot;\nRob Dyke: \u0026ldquo;﻿On open standards. I agree: The NHS excels in this area. You only need look at the CfH Data And Standards Team for some great examples of definition and ownership of standards.\nOn ownership, value and accounting. I was deliberately careful not to refer to \u0026lsquo;free software\u0026rsquo; nor to get into TCO discussions. This is because the truth is open source software has a cost, freely downloadable or otherwise, just like any other software. Software needs implementing with a framework of infrastructure and support with relationships to the vendor or developer in order to resolve issues that arise in the environment. This all contributes to a TCO of an technology environment; the capital expenditure of a license for commercial proprietary software is just one part of the cost calculation.\nThe phenomena of the commercial open source service provider is relatively new in comparison to the longevity of the Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s and IBM\u0026rsquo;s of this world. Commercial open source service providers have a different production logic to the traditional BIG IT vendors. Consider Redhat, the $1bn revenue / $8bn valued software services company. Redhat sell value add services and support around an open source operating system.\nOr Alfresco, who develop and maintain an open source document management and collaboration suite. Like many open source vendors, Alfresco offers customers a Support Subscription which provides users access to:\n Technical Support Services Maintenance fixes, patches, and updates Engineering support / Escalations Alfresco Network – End user support portal Certified stress tested builds Access to the Alfresco Enterprise software  My point being two fold: the first being that open source businesses operate outside the Fordist production line model of software production as a captial project. Rather the product is incrementally developed and expanded, usually with a \u0026lsquo;crowd sourced\u0026rsquo; dymanic. Commercial open source businesses supply support services and priority access to engineering which are chargable, while the software is free (at least, the community editions are free and the Enterprise features available in a subscription). The second being that there is a \u0026lsquo;for profit\u0026rsquo; dynamic in open source software production, just as there is in proprietary software production. You just need to look at what is being sold. Spend a few hundred quid with Microsoft and see what support you don\u0026rsquo;t get from no access to an engineering team. Then spend the same few hundred quid with Alfresco and see what a difference support makes.\n","href":"/2011/04/04/discussing-open-source-on-dotgovlabs/","title":"Discussing open source on DotGovLabs"},{"content":"Brent council says use of Mydex\u0026rsquo;s online personal data service will improve the quality of information it holds on us residents, allowing us to see if the information Brent holds on them is up to date and accurate.\nMydex’s mission is to help individuals realise the value of their personal data.

Frequently we see not \u0026lsquo;zero comments\u0026rsquo; but actually no comments at all.

Most MPs are now communicating online and many have websites, some blogs and a handful maintain a presence on social networking sites. Although the internet does clearly support MPs to become more independent, the primary paradigm remains rooted in the party model. The foregoing suggests that the internet is a tool to communicate outwards, self-promote for the purposes of re-election and to gauge opinion and it is not seen as a tool to aid representation or to enhance engagement: internet-based communication by MPs is largely about delivery and devoid of strategies for engagement.\n(MPs online: Connecting with constituents, 2009, p. 6)  \u0026nbsp; ","href":"/2009/02/24/zero-comments-and-zero-friends-or-how-social-media-is-missused-and-abused-by-government./","title":"Zero Comments and Zero Friends or how 'social media' is missused and abused by government."},{"content":"","href":"/tags/hansard/","title":"Hansard"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s published.\n A new Hansard Society report, sponsored by Microsoft, MPs Online: Connecting with Constituents, reveals that MPs are using the internet primarily to inform their constituents rather than engage with them.

Tony\u0026rsquo;s paper considers the social role of technology with regards to political thought and activity, comparing the liberty of the Ancients with the liberty of the Moderns to discover the liberty of the Networked.\nWith regard to TCPs use of Nozic\u0026rsquo;s Anarchy, State, Utopia to interrogate the hyper-individualised networked society I had this to say (emphasis added):\n Amongst the libertarian Nozick\u0026rsquo;s many failures in Anarchy, State, Utopia is his failure to properly deal with conflict between his ahistorical individuals. It is the abstraction of the individual and the social order in Nozick\u0026rsquo;s work dislocates individuals from themselves, from the choices they make and the communities they form that is the source of conflict. What the neo-Kantian Nozick fails to recognise in demanding the priority of individual rights over the common good is that this \u0026ldquo;can only exist in a certain type of society with specific institutions and that it is a consequence of the democratic revolution.\u0026rdquo; (Chantelle Mouffe, 2005, The Return of the Political, p.65) That is to say that neo-Kantian liberals fail to recognise the historicity of liberalism, for some reason missing the very context of the emergence of liberal political theory from the struggle against arbitrary and absolute authority.\n  So what then of politics in our liberal age? Do we really have to choose between the liberty of the Ancients and the liberty of the Moderns? No. We do not have to accept a false dichotomy between individual liberty and rights, i.e. the choice of the neo-Kantians, or between civic activity and a strong political community. As Mouffe argues \u0026ldquo;Our choice is not only one between an aggregate of individuals without a common public concern and a pre-modern community organized around a single substantive idea of the common good. To envisage the modern democratic political community outside of this dichotomy is the crucial challenge\u0026rdquo; (ibid).\nThe project of the networked liberal is then to defend extend and deepen the liberty of the networked and to democratically build meaningful institutions to articulate and resolve conflict.\n The problematic of what sort of institutions - through which claims, of rights or otherwise, can be articulated and conflict mediated - would work in a networked society is often underthorised at the expense of an over-emphasis on the negative spectres of Orwell, Kafka and other writers on totalitarian politics. I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to play down the dangers to our socio-political relationships, threatened by the database state or the surveillance state. I\u0026rsquo;m simply more interested in the challenge from Mouffe (2005) to find meaningful frameworks beyond the institutions of modern liberal democracy. These are themes continued in Dean, Anderson and Lovink (2006) \u0026lsquo;Reformatting Politics\u0026rsquo;; a collection of papers on the notion of post-democracy, information technology and global civil society.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to post again on this topic with regard to the current fluttering around ideas of new localism in the UKs political settlement as the themes of liberty, democracy and the nature of politics in network society remain open and contested: hackable. Investigating the positive possibilities rather than imagining dark nightmares is my contribution to the Convention and to civil society.\n","href":"/2009/02/18/recently-reading-the-liberty-of-the-networked-at-od/","title":"recently reading \"The Liberty of the Networked\" at oD"},{"content":"When Dave Briggs asks \u0026lsquo;how close is local?\u0026rsquo; on the Local Democracy blog, he asks a very important question about democracy. If democracy is to be the rule of the the people, asking \u0026lsquo;how close is local?\u0026rsquo; is asking the perennial question of democracy: which people? Knowing who is governed is as important as knowing that those people govern themselves.\nOur democracy is stratified like a company organisational chart. A simplistic drawing would show Government at the top and parish councils at the bottom and a myriad of other organisations with decision-marking powers over any number of areas of our daily lives arranged on the intervening levels. An upper tier has a more inclusive scope than a lower tier and roles and responsibilities are appropriately distributed according to scale and competence.\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s the textbook anyway.\nDave\u0026rsquo;s post to LD highlights the problem with that model and the institutions and relations conditioned in practice. Locality is as fluid as other post-modern political problems such as community and identity. Localities dependency is perspective and there are many perspectives.\nSo how do we get away from institutions, or \u0026lsquo;structures\u0026rsquo; as Dave said, that are out of perspective with locality, community and identity? Well, as a good post-structuralist and radical democrat I\u0026rsquo;m not disappointed by exploring that dependency. A broad and rich body of research exists exploring precisely this area of political geography. Indeed, this theme was central to my papers in \u0026lsquo;Hacking the Networked Society\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;Who governs in a networked society\u0026rsquo; explored precisely this growing disjuncture between institutions and governmental frameworks in our contemporary networked society.\nMany boosters talk up the potential of new media in its self to engender new forms of political communications which will have meaning at any / all different tiers of locality. I\u0026rsquo;d say that is simply twittering round the edges, a confusion of quantitative changes, i.e. more engagement, and qualitative changes, i.e. new / different modes of engagement.\nDave\u0026rsquo;s general point about linkages still stands however. Stronger and meaningful relationships between \u0026lsquo;the people\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;the people when they govern\u0026rsquo; need to replace those tried and tired tiered relationships of our contemporary democratic settlement.\n","href":"/2009/02/09/knowing-who-is-governed-is-as-important-as-knowing-that-those-people-govern-themselves./","title":"Knowing who is governed is as important as knowing that those people govern themselves."},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;The Climate Rush is a group of gallant women and intrepid men who will act now to save the world.\u0026rdquo; This is anarchism for the middle classes, or at least those that don\u0026rsquo;t want too much risk when out protesting. This group came to popular attention last year with a take-over of Parliament Square celebrating the centenary of the Suffragette Rush and campaigning in support of three demands: No new coal power stations, an immediate stop to all airport expansion, and 80% reductions in carbon by 2050. With number three ticked off, this group are about to tackle number two with a protest on Monday 12th January 2009, the day that MPs return to parliament.\nWhen the Evening Standard reported this (18th Dec 2008) it was suggested that \u0026ldquo;the protest could emulate the sit-in at Bangkok airport that led to it being shut for several days.\u0026rdquo;\n One source said today: \"If there are only 50 of us I doubt it will stop the airport from running but if there are 500 of us that is a lot of protesters in the check-in area. If we are really successful, we could attract thousands down there and that would stop the airport functioning on the day.\"  So, what\u0026rsquo;s the plan?\n \u0026ldquo;We will arrive in Edwardian dress (under a big coat!) with hampers of food to have our \u0026lsquo;Dinner at Domestic Departures\u0026rsquo;.\u0026quot;\n Not quite the same as the boots and balaclavas of the anti-Stansted expansion special-forces. But the idea is similar. Go to an airport in some kinda costume, make a spectacle for the media and disrupt the normal operations of the airport.\nWhich will be fun! In the photos of the Parliament Square invasion, everyone looks like the are having a riot! Save the planet and have fun!\nThis is civil disobedience. \u0026ldquo;Civil disobedience on grounds of conscience is an honourable tradition in this country, and those who take part in it may well be vindicated by history\u0026rdquo; Lord Justice Hoffman\nOn the recent granting of bail to Climate Rush organiser Tamsin Omond, District Judge Michael Snow spoke of the need for ‘proportionality’ in civil disobedience cases, and his reluctance to refuse bail to someone who was “simply exercising her democratic right to protest”.\n \u0026ldquo;The word ‘democratic’ is key here.

Idiots. If someone really wanted to shutdown an airport and cause over a week of disruption, all they would have to do is get enough people to sit down.\nLast month anti-government protesters in Thailand where able to close the country\u0026rsquo;s major international airport for over a week. Hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of flights were disrupted and rerouted where possible. The world\u0026rsquo;s attention was focused on the protest, shining a light onto the political problems in the country. Most amazing was the peaceful passing off of the protests. I doubt that within a few days the mass sit-in will fade, becoming just a surreal memory. This protest was a success, internally and internationally.\nThe Beeb asks a few questions, some of which are pertinent to the Plane Stupid protesters:\n How could a country as advanced and as dependent on exports and tourism as Thailand allow such a vital transport hub to be stormed by a mob that never numbered more than a few thousand? What is the PAD, and what gives the movement the confidence to commit its dramatic acts of economic sabotage without fearing any legal sanction?  No more than a few thousand people halted a major international airport for over a week. This large group took action with impunity; Thai police could not or perhaps would not use force against these protesters.\nNow, how does all this relate to the old-school black-ops methods of Plane Stupid this last week? To my mind the protest which closed Stansted was a flash in the pan, a stunt. The airport authorities and police responded with force, treating this militaristic assault on key infrastructure as a terrorist attack. Rightly so! What if these were not Plane Stupid protesters but rather stupid hi-jackers?\nEnvironmental protesters like Plane Stupid should take notice of Flash-mobbing, silent raves and other network-powered interventions in the public space. Organise a flash-mob of an airport, all the airports! Just get a lot of people to head to their nearest airport and just sit down\u0026hellip;.\nHere are a few steps to taking over every airport in the country on one day\u0026hellip;\n Pick a day, any day and a time\u0026hellip; just make sure its far enough in the future to allow your network of activists to\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;Buy up tickets on the cheap flights (this is the important part) on that day all around the same time. On the scheduled day, set off with a packed bag, a passport and a ticket to local airport - this is the black-ops part, when the radical environmentalists disguise themselves as people going off for the weekend on a cheap flight. Wait for the agreed time and sit down.  If Plane Stupid or another similar group were to co-ordinate such an action this would be a flashmob of epic proportions causing much more serious and significant disruption to air travel infrastructure.\nYet the real beauty of this networked direct action is that the Plane Stupid protesters would most likely be able to close every airport in the country even without having to turn up on the day. The very threat of this direct action and very fact that of it being discussed openly, perhaps via Facebook or a custom social network site hosted on Ning, would probably be sufficient for the authorities to seriously reconsider opening airports on the appointed day.\nSome may call this weeks action by Plane Stupid terrorism, others may call it civil disobedience. What I\u0026rsquo;m proposing here combines direct action and electronic civil disobedience backed up with the threat of real people turning up and paralysing infrastructure in a very public way. For the cost of a place ticket on, say, the 1st April 2009 (which is cheap if booked now) Plane Stupid could close every airport in the country\u0026hellip;..\nJust a thought.\n","href":"/2008/12/11/plane-stupid-direct-action-meets-networked-civil-disobedience/","title":"plane stupid direct action meets networked civil disobedience"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/freedom-of-information/","title":"Freedom of Information"},{"content":"So, some digital information has leaked from its home.

Is it the speculative \u0026lsquo;unregulated\u0026rsquo; oil trading that William Pfaff, writing in the IHT, criticises? Certainly the black magic of contract trading is a factor, a parasite on the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; market for the commodity. According to the BBC, OPEC has so far blamed price rises on speculators and says there is no shortage of oil. Likewise, Pfaff considers the present situation with rising prices dissimilar to the 1973 oil crisis, when OPEC announced that they would no longer supply oil to nations that supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt.\nPaul Krugman, also in the IHT, is somewhat naive if he thinks that we are entering merely an era of scarce, expensive oil. This is more than an era. The buried sunlight that we like to burn is running out. Scarcity is the true reality. It\u0026rsquo;s more than Half Gone. Not only is the raw material that we are critically addicted to becoming more expensive as it becomes increasingly scarce, feeding our addiction in consuming oil is one of the major causes of global warming.\nIf the price of oil is considered too high, conventional economic models hold that consumption will decrease, or consumers will purchase substitutes. In the seventies \u0026lsquo;markets signals\u0026rsquo; shifted the behaviour of producers and consumers and the state. Cars with smaller engines were manufactured, consumers shifted to public transport and national energy policy was reformulated to take account of the new political factors in the price of oil from the Middle East.\nSo what market signals are needed for our contemporary oil paradigm? Is the price mechanism sufficient for scarcity? Here Krugman has a (complementary) point for Europe. He writes \u0026ldquo;If Europe\u0026rsquo;s example is any guide, here are the two secrets of coping with expensive oil: Own fuel-efficient cars, and don\u0026rsquo;t drive them too much.\u0026rdquo; The taxing of oil is one example of attempts to change the behaviour of oil consumers, hoping to reduce consumption in order to meet environmental targets. Environmental concerns are also behind various harm reduction strategies, demonstrated in EU regulations on emissions and fuel efficiency for new cars, for example.\nProgressive taxation on fuel consumption, emissions regulations, the further regulation of oil trading and other such market signals do not go far enough in altering the behaviour of consumers. According to the The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) \u0026ldquo;Existing initiatives are unlikely to bring about behavioural change on the scale required [to meet 2050 carbon emissions target], with many individuals choosing to disregard the connection between their own emissions and the larger challenge. Personal carbon trading might be the kind of radical measure needed to bring about behavioural change.\u0026rdquo;\nThe high-tech personal carbon credit scheme considered by the EAC, a massive database and accounting system to capture and reconcile the carbon tariff value of economic transactions demonstrates that policy makers have faith that consumer behaviour will, like the economic models tell them, respond to rational market signals. By attaching a price tag and creating a personal market for carbon credits, individuals will spend or save these allowances which will be reflected in the rate of consumption and the rate of adoption of alternatives. If we don\u0026rsquo;t like expensive oil and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to buy additional carbon credits to consume this expensive commodity then we will change our behaviours. Quoted on the BBC website (from BBC Radio 4 Today programme) environmentalist George Monbiot applauded the scheme - \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s more progressive than taxation, it tends to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor; it\u0026rsquo;s transparent; it\u0026rsquo;s easy for everyone to understand, you all get the same carbon ration. It also contains an inbuilt incentive for people to think about their energy use and to think about how they are going to stay within their carbon ration.\u0026rdquo;\nBut why the need for high-tech obfuscation and a national database consolidating and accounting the transactions of private individuals? Besides, to some degree, the market, the private sector that Committee chairman Tim Yeo considers well placed to provide such a massive IT infrastructure, is already responding to the market signals that consumers are recoupling consumption with price and, most importantly, consumption with environmental impact. Smart electricity and gaz meters, carbon emission statements and online footprint calculators are responding to consumer demand for such products and services. Do the Conservatives really want Big Database State to intervene here? Thankfully not - even green Cameo has distanced himself from the idea.\nIf governments are serious about reducing consumption in order to shore-up the economy and to meet climate change and other environmental targets, then more radical action is needed. For Brian Holmes the action is rather simple. Cut your steak in half.\n If North Americans, Europeans, Japanese and Australians would cut their steak in half, take public transportation once in a while and turn off their TV when they\u0026rsquo;re not being hypnotized by it, prices would fall to the level of everyone\u0026rsquo;s dinner table. Then maybe we could not only have more interesting discussions of international relations, but even accept that we all live on this planet together and have the same rights to its abundance.\n So rather than state manipulation of price as a control of scare commodities, what practical steps would radically alter consumption and encourage substitution? Perhaps a national speed limit of 55mph rather than fuel duty or road tax holidays recently proposed in the UK and USA is a more appropriate method of changing consumption for economic and environmental policy goals.\n","href":"/2008/05/26/the-price-of-oil-green-taxes-and-cutting-steaks-in-half./","title":"the price of oil, green taxes and cutting steaks in half."},{"content":"Hacking the Networked Society.\nAbstract: The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists.

In exploring this subjects ontology and its relationships with others I will also question the understanding of purpose, of telos, by this subjectivity. Freedom and openness are two central concepts in hackerism and the contemporary social movements it has influenced. My research will lead me to examine critically the political philosophy of hackerism in order to reveal the meaning in these emerging redefinitions of freedom and openness and the challenge they present to the corresponding dominant liberal notions of the same terms. Communicative Capitalism and F/los - In my third paper I will explore the political economy of contemporary communicative capitalism and f/los. Here I will draw on the networked society ideas from my first chapter and the hacker work ethic from my second. I am conscious of a dynamic between pragmatism and idealism and how this conditions political economy. I am searching for the `positive possibility' of f/los and how this, in transmission, may effect our contemporary order. A New Politics of Openness? - I am not quite sure how this chapter will fit together yet. I am interested in how the hacker idea of freedom, `what kind of rules make possible a good society that is good for the people in it' (Stallman) is be realised. McKenzie Wark, author of `A Hacker Manifesto', in his paper `Escape from the Dual Empire' wrote \u0026ldquo;020. The search for a counter strategy to ‘globalization’, if it does not look backwards to the reinstatement of the topographic boundaries of a lost age, looks forward instead to a new topography, in which the topical might hold the power of the digital, rather than being held within its thrall.\u0026rdquo; I think that the hacker ethic and the open political models of f/los are no longer emergent, existing at the frontiers of our networked society. I contend that they already among us and are radically altering established politics.  I\u0026rsquo;ve just sent the draft of my first paper to my supervisor and I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to run it past my Chief Editor (thanks B).

First of all, the student needs to be co-present with the ballot! This is a given and the only part of the process that can not be virtualised. The student presents some ID before being given a ballot paper. The ballot is privately completed and cast into the ballot box.\nThe Goldsmiths College Students Election e-Voting was extremely vulnerable to exploitation by someone with malicious intent. The e-voting mechanism virtualised the ballot paper instead of virtualising the whole process. Anyone visiting the goldsmithsstudents.com website was able to download a Microsoft Word file. This file used a macro to capture the input of the user; in this case the ranking of the preference of candidates. A student was expected to complete the form, save it, then send the file as an attachment from their college email account to su@gold.ac.uk\nThe most vulnerable part of the whole process is that single file made available for public download.\nIt is possible to replace that single file on the web server with one containing a malicious modification to the macro which would be reported back to the returning officer. Here\u0026rsquo;s how\u0026hellip;\n Using social engineering and/or brute force gain administrative access to the oncampus server which hosts the goldsmithsstudents.com website as an administrator from goldsmiths. Download Word file Modify macro Upload modified Word file  After the e-voting period has ended, the intruder could gain access to the server again and replace the malicious file with the original. This would cover the tracks of the malicious intruder.\nPart one is the tricky part, but with a mixture of social engineering (phone calls, distraction, impersonating �tc) and automated (brute force) login attempts to the (publicly available) administration login, gaining this access is not impossible.\nThe beauty of this crack is two fold. Firstly, the file is replaced with an account that is legitimate and is therefore less likely to arouse suspicion. Secondly, the virtual ballot paper is rigged without anyone being able to spot it.\nThe one part of the GCSU e-voting process that seems sensible to me is the primate method of reducing fraudulent voting; by requiring the virtual ballot paper to be returned from a \u0026lsquo;smiths college email account, some kind of verification of a ballot paper being sent in by a student is possible. However the act of sending the virtual ballot to a generic email address (su@gold.ac.uk) breaks one of the first principles I outlined: the sanctity of the secret ballot.\nIf the whole process had been virtualised the e-voting would have been a lot more secure. A secure webserver with authentication services provided by the college\u0026rsquo;s directory server (as used for email and learn.gold for example) running a simple web ballot application would not have been open to a malicious attack of the type that I have just outlined. Sure, it would have had its own vulnerabilities but the code of the ballot process (the virtual paper) and the sanctity of the ballot booth (a goldsmiths webserver) would warrant greater confidence than the current model.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be straight up and assure you that I\u0026rsquo;ve done no such thing; this is not some back-handed confession - you must be thinking it, right?\n(The only hack I would like to do in these elections is increase participation, and participation is protected by the user sending an email from their college system account. Breaching this measure would require a significant and sustained attack on the goldsmiths college network. Besides, doubling the turnout would obviously arouse serious suspicions!)\nSo why tell you all this? Last week I read an article in computing magazine 2600 by Rop Gonggrijp \u0026lsquo;What it means to be a hacker\u0026rsquo; [1] which called me back to my senses and my technology roots. The story was about electronic voting and the efforts of Dutch-German hacker communities to expose the significant and serious defects in the digitized ballot process. There have been other stories like this in America over the last 5 or 6 years [2].\nOne of the GCSU objectives for the period 2007/08 was to \u0026lsquo;procure an effective e-voting system and integrate into Union elections\u0026rsquo;. This action is \u0026lsquo;Owned\u0026rsquo; by James Hutchinson and was due to delivery in Nov \u0026lsquo;07.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve invited GCSU to comment. Have they procured an effective e-voting system? Have the Union done everything they can to insure the integrity of the e-voting process? Are the Sabbatical Officers confident in its integrity after reading this email? What can they do to ensure confidence in the privacy of the ballot?\n[1] http://blog.wired.com/sterling/2008/02/old-skool-hacki.html\n[2] http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/12/1320208 and many others, search terms slashdot e-voting in google\n","href":"/2008/02/26/how-i-would-have-rigged-the-goldsmiths-college-student-elections.../","title":"How I would have rigged the Goldsmiths College Student Elections..."},{"content":"By the Gods!

This arrangement uses online tools to compliment the traditional Course Rep role to set an agenda for a number of meetings over the course of the college year between the academic staff and the students. As a Program Monitoring Rep I was at the first of the meetings today.\nThere was an agenda. These are my reflections on that meeting. Disclaimer. I would probably say all of the following again. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it anything more than my opinion. The official minutes may more accurately reflect actual events. Mileage may vary. Terms and Conditions Apply. Offers not available to those outside the EU.\nReflections on staff student forum aka The Alternative Minutes  How many people does it take to find the chairs for the Stephen Laurence Committee rooms? Several. Myself included. They were in the cupboard all along. SFG.\nDo I perceive a student/staff disconnection? No, not personally not from anything more than the usual anecdotal murmur, reflecting nothing more than the normal difference in our interpersonal experiences.\nFrom the questions raised at the meeting I can see two distinct aspects, the pastoral and the academic. Just what are personal/academic tutors for? What are the meetings with them for? And should there be a more formal structure for meetings between students and personal/academic tutors? Perhaps the distinction between personal and academic tutors has been eroded with increasing student numbers and with the loss of tutor discretion. Increasing student numbers place a pressure on resources, a point to which I will return. The loss of tutor discretion coupled with the provision of welfare and pastoral services by other parts of the college have also contributed to the decline of the personal tutor.\nThe relationship created by the personal tutor allocation could do with some more introduction. Perhaps complimented with a page in the handbook or as a link from the VLE. But I would not support a mandatory meeting model. Why make meetings mandatory? Students do not make the time to complete even the most fundamental of tasks, e.g. the signing of examination forms, displaying apparent disregard for this crucial requirement. And when the opportunity is made available, a clear majority of students (two thirds in our unscientific poll) do not take it up. With the present system those that do go benefit. Hopefully they will tell their peers about the experience - it was OK, they were a real person, etc\u0026hellip;\nIs the personal tutor to be understood in the sense of a personal trainer, coaching a student onward? I\u0026rsquo;m sure that a number of relationships do have this dynamic. But perhaps the Personal Tutor - I am assured that there ever was such a thing - is now more of a personal Academic Tutor. Those students that take the opportunities to meet with staff benefit from doing so. Those who make the most of the opportunities, more so. And drawing from personal experience of pastoral support from the Department, I have found support and compassion and structure and process. All helpful, at the right time and the right place.\nLecture Protocols  4.1 Policy for late attendees\nHave compassion. Lateness happens. People do have a tough time some of the time.\nYet\u0026hellip;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t do it. It really pisses off students and staff alike. More so when it is persistant.\nStudents and staff should feel that they can speak out - hopefully peer pressure will sort out anything after the compassion has run out.\n4.2 Q+As within lectures\nThis is delicate. It is up to the preference and the direction of a tutor to accept points and questions from the floor. A lot of tutors actively invite contributions during lectures, not just as a rhetorical device! But there can be occasions where a point from the floor becomes an interruption to the flow of the lecture. Something to take to a seminar perhaps\u0026hellip;\nLectures bring us nicely to budgetary matters, sorry, seminars.\nSeminar Arrangements  Picking up the theme of more contact time that is behind the thrust for meetings with tutors\u0026hellip;.. Can we have more seminars please? No, there isn\u0026rsquo;t the money. Can PhD/Master students teach us? No, there isn\u0026rsquo;t the money. This years visiting tutor budget is gone. Its the first week of December. So folks, just remember how the money does _not_ go round next time someone invites you to protest and petition against cuts in higher education.\nVirtual Learning Environment  Overall we think that the VLE is a good thing. It is surprising that a number of students are still not signed up! What can we do to reach those people? I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure why these people are disconnected (and we didn\u0026rsquo;t go into it). The stark discrepancy between courses with regard to use of VLE, with a number of courses not fulfilling the minimum presence requirements of the module outlines, module deadlines and bibliographies, will be addressed by the Department. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take too long, given the electronic nature of all the materials concerned\u0026hellip;.\nBibliographies � Library Resources  The VLE and the library databases can be made to talk to each other! The process of maintaining an often sizable reading list for a course could be supported by electronic tools\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not proposing too radical here\u0026hellip; course reading and extended bibliographies are already typed by academic staff. An interface to the library database and some electronic tools may make the creation and management of bibliographies less time consuming for academic staff and at the same time create new ways of receiving and manipulating that information for students and staff alike.\nDo I think that the Staff Student Forum is a box ticking exercise? No. This structure creates the space for communication between us. Participation from the Richard our Head of Department demonstrates how committed the department is to the process. But to some degree, all these structures are a box ticking exercise\u0026hellip; the proof of the pudding is in the washing up. I hope that we\u0026rsquo;ll see action on the points that realistically achievable by the next meeting (the VLE) and that by next term the experience of returning students will be improved, with accurate information being made available online by the end of term.\nRichard isn\u0026rsquo;t going to find that £100k slipped off the edge of his desk and can now fund more seminars and a flashing logo for the Politics Department VLE virtual office, so I think that we need to refocus our dissatisfaction with the constraints of budgets at those that can actually make a difference. That the department have responded to requests for more contact time by creating weekly seminars for first years is a Good Thing (TM). But at the collapse of courses into each other, reducing the breadth of choice and the depth of material covered.

WYSIWYG systems are characterised by two principal claims: that you type what you want to print, and that what you see on the screen as you type is a close approximation to how your text will finally be printed. The simple answer to the question is, of course, that TeX was conceived long before the marketing term. There is a real conceptual difference between the word processor model of the world and the model TeX uses — the idea of “markup”. Markup expresses a logical model of a document, where every object within the document is labelled according to what it is rather than how it should appear.\nHow do I get TeX for my machine? The TeX Live distribution provides a ready-to-run TeX system. There is a list of choices for more systems on this list here.\nOn my Mac laptop I\u0026rsquo;m running the MacTeX distribution.\n","href":"/2007/11/05/tex-tc.../","title":"TeX \u0026tc..."},{"content":"(even if the content could do with some more work\u0026hellip;)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve not used TeX for several months\u0026hellip; getting to grips with it again today has reminded me of the value of practice in developing a skill.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to blog the development of my focus of study and my argument here and use my wiki and other tools to share resources I\u0026rsquo;ve found useful. I can\u0026rsquo;t wiki my work though - it needs to be all my own effort! But I will be publishing here it after its been submitted - another 10,000 words to add to the global text pool that is the internet.\nMy work will be part political theory and part constructive criticism of contemporary political culture. I am attempting to reimagine politics through the rubric of free/libre open-source concepts. Yes I\u0026rsquo;ve dropped software from F/LOSS. This is because I\u0026rsquo;m not focusing on the technology, rather I am interested in the forms of relationship, social and economic, that f/los concepts and practice have conditioned.\nWhat follows is draft; an emerging rough hack of my ideas that I will develop into a research proposal to submit in a couple of weeks. What will follow between now and April 2008 will be 3 or 4 \u0026lsquo;chapters\u0026rsquo; to make up the completed dissertation. Comments and criticism welcomed. Reference your sources.\n—————\nClosure characterizes the political culture of liberal-democratic nation-states. The balance between these hyphenated concepts is delicate, leaving little but breathing space. Individual liberty is curtailed by democratic mechanisms. Yet democracy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo;, liberated from being cogs, now appear as little more than figures watching the machine continue its work without them. nations implode and states explode as peoples in conflict leave politics for violence. What was once ideal now seems like a bad idea. Worryingly it appears that these weakly linked concepts are the only ideas left.\nUnderpinning or central to or however your perspective orders all these hyphenated concepts and the institutions they configure are economic activities and social relationships. In some societies these are still quite distinct from each other, in others the distinction is blurring. The tendency is towards the subsuming of the social into the economic. Capitalism towers above `the market', now large-scale, diversified and abstracted, and moves on seeking new arenas where transactions take place to capitalize. Embrace, extend and extinguish?\n`i\u0026rsquo;ve never had it so good', apparently.\nis this to be the political settlement of the contemporary west? centricist politics for a figurative people, a depoliticised economy capitalizing the life-world and a fragmented society, only capable of uniting, `democratically' of course, against whatever of whoever is momentarily defined as outside, a minority.\nThe \u0026ldquo;contemporary proliferation of political spaces and the multiplicity of democratic demands\u0026rdquo; (Mouffe, 2000, p.17) needs a new politics, a politics that works at the global and the local, the universal and the particular. New relationships of interconnectedness between people, communities, identities, things, locations and events need to be reflected in the political culture of our institutions. What are the dynamics of these relationships? Where are these new political spaces emerging in such a tightly closed political culture?\nThe meshing of the politics of the Hacker, the Artist and the Activist has crystallised into a manifesto for free/libre and open-source, f/los. Increasing contact with f/los artefacts, technologies and economies and the wider dissemination of f/los concepts is raising popular consciousness of emerging redefinitions for master concepts such as freedom, property and ownership. Freedom and openness are the two ideas central to the hacker culture and the movements it has influenced. These two ideas are by no means fixed definitions. Indeed it is the very flexibility of these ideas and the way in which they are redefined that is of interest to me.\nMy research project will explore the politics and economics of contemporary western societies demonstrating what I consider to be the rhetoric of openness and the reality of closure. My script with be both critical and constructive. I will reconsider the contents of the hyphenated `master concepts' and consider their opportunity for renewal using the rubric of f/los.\nReferences\n Mouffe, C., (2000) The Democratic Paradox Verso, London\n","href":"/2007/11/02/research-proposal-for-my-politics-degree/","title":"research proposal for my politics degree"},{"content":"Goldsmiths SU has successfully campaigned for changes in the opening hours of the colleges library and ICT facilities.

A great opportunity to discuss how open accessible data could further develop participation in the up keep of the Borough. Brent Council considering working with a Made In Brent technology organisation and mobile technologies. Brent Council entertaining the public publishing daily status and performance information online. I was also keen to know more about the current use of mobile technologies by Brent and also about the techie stuff that pins their operations together.\nBrent receive problem reports by several means and log them all into a central application. Incoming emails, texts and phone calls are entered into the application which dispatches messages to contractors for them to deal with the report. I understood from our meeting that some of what Civic Report does the Council is either about to deliver or is working towards delivering.\nAfter a few mildly insulting comments about the status and stature of the comwifinet organsiation and a few about the council representatives own department and employer, I felt that the meeting was beginning to go somewhere. I talked about the positive opportunities that could be seized by publishing data and creating a interactive map thing for people to use. But before we looked at the application I knew that the meeting was a waste of time; mine and theirs. They talked about their perceived negative stumbling blocks that would prevent them for using something like Civic Reporter. In short it came down to status and money. The person meeting with me thought the comwifinet organisation was of low status and was therefore unwilling to recommend to his managers that Brent Council commit public money to us, this unknown quantity. Yet other very large public organisations spend with us - we just choose not to shout about it on our website.\nA few days I got an email by a round-about way that let me know that Brent were not interested in pursuing Civic Reporter with Comwifinet. Shame that the people I met with were unable to get back to me directly.

Read more\u0026hellip;.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the process vote counting the votes as outlined by Matthew Mannion from Brent Council Democratic Services department.\nWednesday: All the postal vote that had already come in were sorted into wards, checked for validity (i.e. did they contain a ballot paper � declaration). We then totted up the number for each ward (they aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;counted\u0026rsquo; at this stage simply organised into wards).\nThursday: The postal votes that come in on Thursday go through the above process; that starts at 9pm, and, as more came in from the polling stations they were added.\nFor the first round of wards: First each box was counted to ensure that the number of ballot papers inside it was what was expected (i.e what the presiding officer at that polling station told us it was). Once confirmed, the papers are counted into unsorted bundles and placed in the \u0026lsquo;mixing\u0026rsquo; bowl.\nHere is a picture of the ballot boxes \u0026lsquo;backstage\u0026rsquo; at the count.\nThe total number of postal votes received from the postal vote checks are also counted to ensure they are as expected too. Once all the boxes have been checked and the papers are in the mixing bowl, the papers are mixed up so that no one can tell which polling station they came from and then dished out to the counters to separate into piles for the different parties and a mixed pile.\nWhilst they are doing this they take out any papers that they aren\u0026rsquo;t sure about (i.e. that are likely to be spoilt) for the returning officer to check later. Straight party votes are counted into bundles of 50 and put on the centre table. The mixed votes are counted onto a mix sheet (as you no doubt saw). The totals from this are then added to the totals from the straight votes.\nThe totals created and checked then the agents are called in to see if they are happy or want a recount. At this point the returning officer goes through the spoilt votes to say why they are being rejected.\nThe results are then declared.\n","href":"/2006/05/19/how-are-votes-counted/","title":"How are votes counted?"},{"content":"Speaking on the \u0026lsquo;carnage\u0026rsquo; following the local elections in Brent, Labour Cllr Mary Arnold acknowledges that Team Yellow worked hard for the victories they knotched up:\n \u0026ldquo;There is also the Teather factor - there\u0026rsquo;s a machinery that the Lib Dems have got for producing leaflets and campaigning, for bringing people in to canvass.\u0026rdquo;\n The Lib Dems did manage to distribute a lot of paper in Mapesbury and Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park - significantly more than teams Red and Blue.\nWhat will the Teather Factor mean in the light of the new Brent Council?

Some of you voted for three candidates from the same party (a block vote), some of you for candidates from two or more parties (a split vote). Some people voted for two candidates: in Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park there were two Green Party candidates, voting only for them would have been a block Green vote but would have left one vote unallocated. If you voted for Rocky Fernandez only, you would have not allocated two of your votes.\nIn Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park, 3642 voters turned out giving a total of 10,929 potential votes. The results show 9,320 votes were cast, leaving 1,606 unallocated votes. Interesting\u0026hellip;if these votes had been cast would Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park still be Yellow?

Shahrar Ali, Green Party candidate in Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park has been analysing the results as 1,606 unallocated votes appears \u0026ldquo;inexplicably large\u0026rdquo; to him.\n The discrepancy is inexplicable on three grounds: (1) in comparison to adjacent wards, Kensal Green (387) and Kilburn (827); (2) in comparison to Queens Park in 2002 (513 on 25% turnout); and (3), more fatally, an approximation of the ratio of unspent votes to used votes that must have shown on ballot papers in the \u0026ldquo;mixed\u0026rdquo; pile (where cross-party voting took place) for the overall count TO BE TRUE. Unfortunately, that ratio is CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS OBSERVED.

The fact remains that the sooner more people go to the initial expense of installing solar panels, the sooner prices will come down and everyone will have them.

The Council is not prepared to have an open public consultation about the proposal. My view is that the people who elected me as their councillor deserve to be informed about the proposal.\nThe Council was in extensive pre-application talks with the proposed developer, Genesis, from at least the middle of 2004. In April 2005, the Council amended the planning guidance relating to the site to allow for a building of up to 20 storeys paving the way for Genesis\u0026rsquo;s planning application for a set of twin 26-storey towerblocks. The Council persuaded them to withdraw it in September 2005 due to the unexpected level of public opposition to the proposal.\nUnfortunately, the proposal is not dead. Genesis will be making a new application after the May 2006 iocal elections when the Labour leadership, if re-elected, will not have to worry about the electoral consequences of building a concrete and glass skyscraper on the edge of\nThe Labour leadership refuse to change the planning policy for the site, which calls for a 20storey building. They opposed a Libdem motion criticising the Council\u0026rsquo;s policy of encouraging towerblocks. Planning permission for a tall building will increase the value of the land. The Council owns the land and has agreed sell it off to the developer, so it has a vested interest in making the tower as tall as possible to maximise profits from the sale.\nBrent Council has set up a \u0026ldquo;Stakeholder Forum\u0026rdquo; to discuss the new planning application that will be submitted after the May 2006 elections. You might think that is a good idea. It is a total sham. You can\u0026rsquo;t take part because it is not even open to the public. Participation is by invite only. Just eight local residents have been allowed to attend - completely outnumbered by other people at the meeting who have other vested interests. A genuine public consultation would be open to all.\nAt the first stakeholder forum, the Council revealed the ground floor plans of three new proposals, but refused to say how tall each proposal would be! The Council will reveal the height of each proposal at the next meeting due to take place after the May election!!! The Council and Genesis came to the meeting unwilling to discuss the height of the proposed building! The conclusion I draw from their secrecy is that the proposed height will be as unacceptable as it was under the previous planning application.\nThe policy of the currently labour controlled Council is to support the proposal. Although I am a labour Councillor, I am totally opposed to the plan and I am appalled at the Council\u0026rsquo;s secrecy about their intentions and their refusal to respond to public opposition to the proposal. As a result, I am not standing as a candidate myself in May 2006. I have enjoyed representing the people of Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park of the last four years and I wish you all a happy, tower free future!\nPrinted and Published by Cllr Jonathan Davies.

Team:Yasmin may have been able to pull in the \u0026lsquo;names\u0026rsquo; of old Labour but Team:Sarah was superior in people power. The Lib Dems were able to distribute a far greater quantity of campaign materials due to the number of voulenteers at their disposal. I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to discover if the LDYS were mobilised to support the Brent East Campaign in the same way that the Young Fabians were.\nFrom a technology perspective, Team:Sarah already had an established web presense which provided a source of information on her candidacy. Team:Yasmin were severly lacking in this area. Not having a website must have been detrimental to her campaign. Anyone using a search engine to uncover information about Yasmin would have been presented with a series of news articles - some more favorable than others - as well as a link to this site, whereas the search results for the Blue Team and the Orange Team yeilded links to official information sites.\nI have been monitoring the \u0026lsquo;refering links\u0026rsquo; statistics (see Note 1) for my website. The blog has been viewed by people refered to it after using the names of candidates in search engines (see Note 2). Another popular search term is Brent East. Searching for Brent East in Google gives the results of my blog, the websites of the Lib Dems and the Conservatives but not Labour. Even Rainbow George manages to make the first page of links (see Note 3).\nBrent East Campaigning: Misrepresentation\nMy Brent East Campaigning blog did not cover the whole constituency. A more accurate title would have been \u0026lsquo;Mapesbury, Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park and Kilburn Campaigning\u0026rsquo; as these are the areas I have gathered most of my information from. Perhaps I should have done a little ward walking. In hindsight that would have been valuable as my favorite \u0026lsquo;finds\u0026rsquo; of materials have been picked off the street. Additionally, the two main contenders in the recent campaign, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, produced campaign materials that targeting specific communities in the constituency. I would have liked to have been able to post materials from other areas in Brent East. The opportunity to compare and contrast materials from other areas of the constituency would have been interesting: were the candidates/parties emphasing different aspects of their manifesto in different area?\nBrent East Campaigning: Participation\nMy active contribution to this blog over the last 6 weeks totalled 53 postings. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how many hours total was spent meeting candidates, scanning campaign materials and researching details. This blog has been viewed by 816 unique visitors (measured by IP address) and I\u0026rsquo;ve recevied 5 emails from readers contributing information and one comment on a posting. I would have liked to have seen greater contributions from Brent East residents, but I feel that given that the blog was only running for 8 weeks total without link propagation (other than Richard Kimbers Election resources page) the level of readership and contribution was high.\nBrent East Campaigning: Pretty Pictures\nHere are some images grabbed from StatCounter.com\nThis graphic shows the daily \u0026lsquo;hits\u0026rsquo; to the blog since my first post up to the day of the election.\nThis graphic shows period from 9th April to 9th May.\nThis graphic shows the period 3rd May to 9th of May in detail\u0026hellip;\nNote 1: A refering link is the link that directed a viewer to a website.

What interested me was Sarah\u0026rsquo;s answer to this final question: How will you convince Brent voters to give you another term as MP?\n \u0026ldquo;I am going to have to work extremely hard over the next two years because many people voted for me partly on a protest. Some people voted for me because our policies but some people also voted against Tony Blair and I am going to need to persuade those people that there are positive reasons for voting for me. I intend to work extremely hard to pick up local issues and champion individual cases and local campaigns to prove to them that I will be an extremely hard-working MP. But I think the reaction that I\u0026rsquo;ve had so far, I\u0026rsquo;m not too complacent, but the warmth and the sense from local people has been that they want to see me have the chance to succeed.\u0026rdquo;\n Are the electorate of Brent pleased with Sarah Teather? Are they going to give her another term as MP? My feeling, from walking around Brent East, is that this area will return Sarah to parliament as their elected representative. The 5:1 ratio of Liberal Democrat posters to Labour posters is a clear indication of the support for Sarah.\nI bumped into Sarah last Sunday while she was out and about in the Mora/Temple Road area canvassing for support. We talked about how she and other candidates at the 2003 by-election shattered the 13,000 majority that Labour had won in the 2001 General Election. Sarah\u0026rsquo;s majority in 2003 was 1,118, on a turnout of 36.2%.\nI have two hopes. Firstly, I hope that Sarah is returned to parliament with an increased majority. She works hard on local issues, questioning the council and government about services in Brent East and holding them to account. She has championed individual cases and worked hard to see them through to completion in spite of poor communication and late responses from Labour ministers. She\u0026rsquo;s even learning Gujarati!\nSecond, that who ever wins this seat is sent to parliament following a strong turnout from voters. The by-election turnout was low, but by-elections usually are. At the General Election in 2001, turnout was 51.9%. Nationally, turnout is in decline. I would like to see Brent East buck that national trend and return whoever is elected from a 60%-plus turnout.\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s my colours nailed to the mast.\n","href":"/2005/04/20/how-will-you-convince-brent-voters-to-give-you-another-term-as-mp/","title":"How will you convince Brent voters to give you another term as MP?"},{"content":"The candidates in the Brent East constituency have been announced.

She was out on the campaign trail, meeting and greeting, probably kissing babies, seeking places to display her posters. Yasmin was accompanied by the Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park ward local Councillor Neil Nerva.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve met Neil Nerva before. He contacted me about Comwifinet and the Queen\u0026rsquo;s Park Wireless Club. We talked about the community project and about encouraging participation in the democratic process. I told him about the Sarah Teather Blog, and we talked about \u0026lsquo;Why Politicians Need Weblogs.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve emailed him a couple of times via his @brent.gov.uk email address. I\u0026rsquo;ve even called him and left messages on his answer machine. But since that first telephone conversation, all efforts as contacting him have resulted in no response. When I pushed him on this, he said something about \u0026lsquo;having a job and working hard\u0026rsquo; and then he was interrupted by Yasmin how wanted to point out that they are working harder than Sarah Teather. It is no longer a mystery why Sarah is not getting prompt responses from the Labour government - the whole party, from the cabinet and ministers down to local councillors are poor communicators who fail to return calls or emails.\nBut I digress.\nMeeting Yasmin Qureshi was squally, pressured and damp. It was windy and we were just about to be showered by hail. Neil was blustered about by the weather. Yasmin, ever smiling, was pleased to talk to me - a young voter, unlikely to vote at all but most likely to vote LibDem. I talked about the \u0026lsquo;political web log movement\u0026rsquo; and about the blog I run about Sarah Teather. Yasmin was keen to know if I was \u0026lsquo;engaged\u0026rsquo; by Sarah to write the blog and wanted to know if I was critical of her. I told her she could read it and leave comments on the blog - for that is the purpose of the comments button!\nBrent East was taken from Labour by Sarah and the Lib Dems in \u0026lsquo;03. For Yasmin, this means that the electorate deserted Labour due to the illegal and immoral war waged by the UK and US in Iraq. Well, I paraphrase. Yasmin sees Sarah as a hypocrite. She, Yasmin that is, hammers on about how the LibDems were \u0026lsquo;anti-war\u0026rsquo; yet \u0026ldquo;Sarah voted for further troop deployments in Iraq\u0026rdquo;. For Yasmin, the Lib Dems should not have support the government in their efforts rebuild and repair what had been broken into a million tiny pieces by war. From what I can make out, Yasmin thinks it is more important to stand firm to ones principles (being anti-war) rather than be pragmatic and flexible and prepared to support secondary measures (i.e. troop deployments).\nI pointed out the EDM signed by Sarah and other MPs that would remove the royal perogative of military engagement from the cabinet and place the decision in the hands of parliament. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get chance to ask Yasmin if she would support this EDM if she was elected - Neil was herding her away.\nAs a parting shot, Yasmin asked me if I had googled her name. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t, but I have now. Well well well.

You\u0026rsquo;d have thought that there \u0026lsquo;additional costs\u0026rsquo; would have amounted to two annual London Transport travel cards given their proximity to Westminster.\nThe Independent, having managed to curtail its righteous indignation, provided this insight into our own incumbent member. Having illustrated that Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, claimed the maximum allowance of £20,333, it goes on to show that \u0026ldquo;In the neighbouring constituency of Brent East, the Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Teather does not claim the allowance because the journey to Westminster takes only half an hour.\u0026rdquo;\nGo Sarah!\nBut the \u0026lsquo;additional costs allowance\u0026rsquo; is troublesome to me. The inner London weighting allowance of £3,441 for Nurses, not to mention other public sector employees, are far short of the £20,333 that MPs see fit to reward themselves. The need for subsidised key-worker housing, such as Erin Court that Sarah recently opened, is testament to poor financial reward given to those *key-workers*.\nYou can find out about the Members' Allowances for both houses via a link on the Parliament website\n","href":"/2004/10/29/mps-expenses/","title":"MP’s expenses"},{"content":"The QPWC is live.\nWe are currently working on the final few elements of the club formation and then all you prospective members can start signing up.\nThe equipment used to connect home desktop PC\u0026rsquo;s will be arriving with Comwifinet early next week, along with the hardware for more network nodes to increase coverage and quality of service in area.\nAlso, a colaborative self-assistance forum will go live early next week.

I asked her what steps would the Liberal Democrats take to combat SPAM? Would the LD\u0026rsquo;s advocate OPT-IN or OPT-OUT measures? Would LD\u0026rsquo;s toughen up privacy laws to protect my contact details or will they be relaxed?\nSarah was prompt in her response. I wrote using her direct @parliament.uk email on the 13th and received a written reply on the 15th. Sarah must be working on improving her responsiveness - she\u0026rsquo;s currently responding to 48% of FaxYourMP communications within 14 days.\nThe advice Sarah gives on stopping unsolicited communications is sound. For reducing telephone and fax spam, Sarah recommends registering with the Telephone and Fax Preference service. By lodging your numbers with the TPS/FPS it becomes illegal for an organisation to send unsolicited communications to them. If a company ignores this preference, they could incur a fine. Although Sarah has \u0026ldquo;doubts about how effective the TPS and FPS are in enforcing the rules\u0026rdquo;, she feels that registering with them is the \u0026ldquo;best first step\u0026rdquo;. So I\u0026rsquo;ve registered my telephone numbers with them and I\u0026rsquo;ll be letting Sarah know if the ammount of SPAM is reduced.\nWith regards to unsolicited communications received electronically, Sarah gives details of the European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications that was introduced with effect from 11 December 2003. There is further information on the directive at the website of the Information Commissioner\u0026rsquo;s Office. The only drawback that Sarah sees is that there are \u0026ldquo;rogue companies operating from outisde the jurisdiction\u0026rdquo; of the E.U. (which, for me, means those 419 \u0026lsquo;advance fee\u0026rsquo; scams from Nigeria and those \u0026lsquo;All the Meds you need\u0026rsquo; mails from the last bastion of the free world, the USA) that are able to bulk mail without fear of retribution.\nAnd where do the LibDem\u0026rsquo;s stand on the privacy and protection of citizens personal information? Sarah states that the Lib Dem\u0026rsquo;s would not look to relax any legislation on the control of access to personal data. She writes of Lib Dem \u0026ldquo;concerns over the Government\u0026rsquo;s plans to create national databases of the information help about its citizens.\u0026rdquo; While Sarah sees that there could be advantages in common data standards and methods of data exchange between different government department systems, she has concerns about the potential for misuse or even \u0026ldquo;abuse\u0026rdquo; of personal information. She goes on to explain:\n \u0026ldquo;We believe that Government must take the approach that it has in effect a contractual relationship with citizens to hold data on their behalf. This means that it should only hold data where this can be justified in the public interest. Government has no business holding personal data for any reason other than carrying out its functions in serving the public. It should explain why it is holding data and consider whether there is broad public agreement to that data being held. It should seek the consent of the citizen for the collection of that data and explain the purposes for which it will be used. And it should publish explicit rules for the exchange of data between various arms of the Government showing why such exchanges are necessary.\u0026rdquo;\n Perhaps a written \u0026lsquo;contract\u0026rsquo; would ensure the destruction of documents prior to disposal to prevent identity theft - it would stop things like this happening.\n","href":"/2004/10/20/privacy-and-spam/","title":"Privacy and SPAM"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/spam/","title":"SPAM"},{"content":"Today Sarah celebrates the first anniversary of being elected to serve Brent East. 365 Days in office.

However, the Secretary Of State is able to ask the Chief Executive of Royal Mail Group to reply directly to Sarah to answer this question. What power! I bet if I wrote to the Chief Executive asking for that information it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too forthcoming!\nSarah also asked if the Government would be introducing something similar to the Address Preference Service for email.\nStephen Timms replied \u0026ldquo;The Government introduced the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations in December 2003, which cover, among other things, the regulation of unsolicited commercial e-mails. The Government have no plans to introduce an e-mail preference service.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;The Government have not ruled out extending the \u0026ldquo;opt-in\u0026rdquo; right to corporate subscribers. However, as the regulations have only been in force for seven months, it is too early to assess how the new provisions are working in practice, and what areas, if any, might need to be reviewed.\u0026rdquo;\n Even if the Government did introduce legislation to combat SPAM, I don\u0026rsquo;t have much hope for its effectiveness. The ICO (Information Commissioner\u0026rsquo;s Office) is the body that has responsibility to ensure that those registered on the Fax Preference Service and the Telephone Preference Service are not contacted by unsolicited communication. It is this body that issues enforcement notices and would pass a file to the CPS for prosecution.\nStephen Timms clarified the legislation in a written answer to Sarah: \u0026quot; A company or individual that contravenes an enforcement notice commits a criminal offence and, upon successful prosecution, could be subject to a fine of up to £5,000 in a magistrates court.\u0026quot;\nHowever, Sarah was asking the Secretary of State for the numbers of successful prosecutions since 1999. The response? \u0026ldquo;As the ICO has no evidence that the companies and individuals against whom notices have been issued warrant prosecution, to date no fines have been imposed in respect of contravention of these rules.\u0026rdquo;\nSounds like the ICO is a paper tiger.\nI wonder if the Lib Dems are going to come out with a SPAM policy? Or maybe this little bit of research was carried out to discover how effective current legislation / administration is in order to workout the cost saving of abolishing it.\n","href":"/2004/10/13/stopping-spam/","title":"Stopping Spam!"},{"content":"In last weeks Willesden \u0026amp; Brent Chronicle, Sarah wrote of the recent silly season for the UK\u0026rsquo;s political parties, hammered home the message that the Lib Dems are now the second party of British Politics (although, not yet Her Majesty\u0026rsquo;s Official Opposition) and invited us to make a cup of tea while waiting for the pre-manifesto to download.\n\u0026ldquo;The Conference Feelgood Factor\u0026rdquo;\n It is conference season. To those uninterested in politics the annual tradition of political gatherings with their set piece speeches and media razzmatazz in some seaside town must seem a little odd. For political parties, however, they are one of the highlights - or low points - of the year, depending on how things are going!\n  \u0026hellip;\n  For me, this Lib Dem annual conference had another special feel. It was exactly a year since I had been elected. My last conference was lost in a haze of media interviews following the by-election. There had been a mood of euphoria this time last year. But this year, what struck me was how upbeat and confident the party remains, especially in contrast to the rather sour mood of the Labour conference. It has been a tremendous year for us as a Party and there is a new optimism amongst activists -my colleague Parmjit Singh Gill won in the Leicester South by-election and we came from third to push Labour to the wire in both the Hartlepool and Birmingham Hodge Hill by-elections.\n  \u0026hellip;\n  In huge swathes of the country like here in Brent East, it is the Conservatives who are firmly established as the third party. The third party are now on their third leader in three years.

Despite two public inquiries related to the intelligence on which the case for war was made, there remain serious unanswered questions involving Mr. Blair’s involvement in making that case, which was based on a false premise: that Iraq’s WMDs posed a threat to Britain. These questions were deliberatly put beyond the remits of both the Hutton and Butler reports.\nIn the report, Glen Rangwala and Dan Plesch give numerous examples of statements made by the prime minister which, by omission, exaggeration and semantic trickery, they believe painted a misleading picture of the intelligence available to him at the time.\nWhere do you stand on this issue? Will you be supporting moves taken to impeach Tony Blair? I urge you to vote to try Tony Blair before parliament so that this matter can finally be resolved and the country’s confidence in the government of parliament restored.\nYours,\nRob Dyke\n","href":"/2004/08/27/will-sarah-vote-to-impeach-blair/","title":"Will Sarah vote to impeach Blair?"},{"content":"Blogging has been light this last week or so.

We spoke about a number of things: blogging (needless to say), engaging with constituents, getting voice for unreported activities, technology as a barrier (for BELD!) and as an enabler (for local people) and also a little project I’ve been working on.\nHow Sarah engages with her constituents\nThe BELDs maintain an office on the Willesden High Road. You couldn’t be more central in the Brent East constituency if you tried. The office has an open door policy for people to drop in for information (in multiple languages) and to make appointments to meet Sarah. This is in addition to the surgeries held. Sarah feels that this is the most direct way of engaging with the local people, if not the most cost effective. At the very least, she is LOCAL. High visibility. High availability.\nI commented last week on the recent survey exercise being undertaken by Sarah. I was highly critical of the online version of the survey. Discussing this with Sarah, I have understood cost to be a barrier to producing an online version – although I suspect that someone has been over-quoting or under-specifying their services for that to be the case. I have volunteered to give some assistance in setting up a survey function for the BELD website. I mean, come on, it’s only a Perl script at most!\nSarah outlined to me how the offline version of the survey is being carried out. Those of you who have met Sarah on your doorstep recently will already be aware. Sarah believes that by posting and collecting the survey IN PERSON (assuming someone is in), she is demonstrating her direct involvement with and personal commitment to the Brent East constituents.\nPosted late to our meeting on the BELD website is a news piece about the recent survey. It thanks those local residents who have responded and highlights a number of ‘grot spots’ that Sarah promises action on.\nThe ‘Disproportionate Cost’ problem.\nI was a little deriding of the statistical information being asked for in the survey. Those of you who have read any of the Parliamentary Questions and Answers from Hansard (although TWFU.com does it better) will have seen the answer ‘Information is not collected centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost’. Discussing this with Sarah I’ve understood that the data BELD are trying to gather plugs gaps in centrally available data and she intends to use it to focus and prioritise her efforts in improving the social circumstances of her constituents. Good! We get the chance to tell it like it is, Sarah then will act.\nWhat Sarah Does versus What Gets Reported\nDuring June I offered a fiver to anyone who spotted Sarah in Brent East. I now have the whereabouts of my MP for that period.\nWhat didn’t get reported during that period was the opening of a new Cardiology Unit at Central Middlesex Hospital by Sarah, along with a Hostel for Brent MIND who’s dual diagnosis work Sarah strongly supports She also opened an Advisory Centre for Age Concern in South Kilburn.\nThe press releases for these activities were not posted due to staff illness. If Sarah and her team maintained even a small section of their site as a blog (in a similar way to their LD colleague Lynne Featherstone this could have been avoided\u0026hellip;for the time taken to write an email. Blogging would allow Sarah to get her message across directly, avoiding the fickle judgement of local news editors or a dependency on a single member of staff.\nThe Political Weblog Movement. Briefly.\nAt the beginning of our meeting Sarah made it clear that blogging was not on her list of methods of communicating with her constituents, feeling her office in the centre of the constituency, the open door policy, street walking and surgeries make her easily reached. We did speak about the internet as a tool and how it is employed by Sarah’s team for communication.\nGoing forward.\nSarah and her team have been working on a Diary Digest mail. I’ll be receiving that and posting it her. I’ll carry on giving coverage, campaigning, commenting, criticising and perhaps occasionally complimenting the work of Sarah Teather here.\nDoes this work out as a win for Sarah? I carry on doing those things for her – and she gets free publicity! Or does she\u0026hellip;? With this blog riding the search results, it’ll soon become the single most authoritative (as for as the web is concerned) site for Sarah Teather. (Rubs hands with glee)\nAs I said at our meeting, I’m not anti-Sarah Teather nor anti-Liberal Democrat’. But if there is to be no forum for discussion on the BELD website, with involvement from Sarah, then perhaps here is the next best thing.\nSarah, thanks once again for your time. I hope that we can continue to work together for the greater benefit of Brent East. And I thank your staff in advance for their support in this by forwarding me Diary Digests, Press Releases and other items for the blog.\nI encourage you to consider registering an account with Blogger and to post comments here.

I know a large capturing exercise has been taking place recently - I\u0026rsquo;ve participated in it.\nQuestion Set 2 - Education\nOther than gathering whether or not a household has a member attending a local authority provided education facility, data available from census and enrollment figures, this question set has the purpose of gaging support for the \u0026lsquo;Scrap Tuition Fees\u0026rsquo; campaign. The two - satisfaction with local authority provided education and univeristy tuition fees - are not linked. Why link them here?\nQuestion Set 3 - Health\nFrom what I understand of the performance monitoring within the NHS, the data gathered by this quesiton set is already available. (I\u0026rsquo;ll google for it later). Again, questions are being used as a method of gaging support for existing LD campaigns - rather than asking for input on what residents actually want campaigns on.\nQuestion Set 4 - Crime\nCrime. The issue guaranteed to get the blood pumping in the electorate. Nothing like the fear of crime to keep neo-cons in government. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure that stats on unreported crime are already available. There is a missed opportunity here. Why not ask residents how they feel (or even if they are aware!) about the Safer Neighbourhoods initiative launched only last week.\nQuestion Set 5 - Roads and Pavements\nAssign a rating of either /Poor/Adequate/Good/ for roads and pavements in my local area. And if I am aware of any repairs that need doing I\u0026rsquo;m to write them in a 3cm X 5cm box. A further missed opportunity! Why not get some feedback on the \u0026lsquo;Grot Spot\u0026rsquo; campaign?\nQuestion Set 6 - About You\nSome demographic data gathering. And a second space for me to supply my email address (keen on these email addresses arn\u0026rsquo;t they - but the BELDs don\u0026rsquo;t quite seem to \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; how to use technology to either advantage. more below).\nHave Your Say!\nWell, I am glad that there is a least a small \u0026lsquo;free text\u0026rsquo; area on this double A4 side questionnaire. It measures 3cm X 5cm. Hope that the \u0026lsquo;issues or problems\u0026rsquo; residents would like the BELDs to campaign on (note that it is \u0026lsquo;campaign on\u0026rsquo;, not \u0026lsquo;take direct action\u0026rsquo; to resolve) locally.\nUse Of Technology\nI’m going to have to get critical now. Think for a moment what a survey is. You get together a whole bunch of questions (lets disregard for a moment that questions are loaded to only ever to support ones own views), you ask the questions of someone, you capture the information, you review it and report on it.\nSo, what use is it to have the survey as a downloadable PDF? A Brent constituent now has to print off the survey, fill it in and return it to the BELD office. Upon arrival in the BELD office, it\u0026rsquo;ll be opened (hopefully the envelope will be recycled - and the paper the questionnaire is printed on) and the data will be captured - I hope electronically, but given the data gathering method is paper based I\u0026rsquo;m not holding out much hope.\nWhy not have questionnaires as a web forms? Users of the website would be able to complete the questionnaire online and the BELD office could receive the data electronically for a quick CTRL-C / CTRL-V into a spreadsheet.\nThis last criticism is perhaps only a nit-pick. The link doesn\u0026rsquo;t go directly to the file to be downloaded. It goes to a page with PDF downloads. The first (and only) \u0026lsquo;Residents Survey\u0026rsquo; document visible on the page (and I run at 1024×768 resolution) is from 2003.

And with good reason. So I\u0026rsquo;m not going to repeat it here.\nBut I would like to highlight a few bits of the Guardian article.\n \u0026ldquo;Although the public might think otherwise, a lot of MPs do not have a great deal of money,\u0026rdquo; explains Ferguson. \u0026ldquo;Most are short-staffed and short of time but the blogging platform is going to be really useful to MPs because it cuts down the price of the maintenance costs of their websites. Blogs costs virtually nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n Blogs do cost very little to setup. From a technological point of view, there is very little stopping the main political parties from setting up central blog infrastructure and providing default design templates and saying \u0026lsquo;get on with it\u0026rsquo;. I mean, to a greater of lesser degree that is what the LDs already do - their local party sites are all similar in look and feel.\nBut we know how difficult it can be to get tecknology (sic) on the agenda.\nWhy are MPs reluctant to get direct with their online ineractions? Labour\u0026rsquo;s Richard Allan, MP for Sheffield Hallam says \u0026ldquo;To be perfectly frank, when I talk to colleagues, they are concerned about their reputations and by being too honest. MPs are worried [about blogs] because they don\u0026rsquo;t want things taken down and quoted back at them. But a blog only works if it is personal and honest.\nI\u0026rsquo;m having trouble working out why my elected representitive would be concerned about being too honest. And while I agree that quote/unquote journalism is obstructive to progress and change in opinion and mood, it is important that honesty and integrity are at the front of communications with the people.\nWhich is why I don\u0026rsquo;t want to see a US-ian style - staff written with approved spin - of weblog from UK politians.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s next - that\u0026rsquo;s the question a few of us have been asking.

She promises \u0026ldquo;real action to tackle these problems\u0026rdquo;.\nIf Sarah was a blogger, she may have discovered the The Willesden Herald blog (delivering all the news that\u0026rsquo;s unfit to print). Over recent weeks, they have had photos of fly-tipping blocking roads around the area.\nSarah comments that \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;often people just can\u0026rsquo;t tell what council taxpayers money is being spent on.\u0026rdquo; Well, perhaps that is true. Some people are ignorant to the obvious.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t quite see the point - other than the political one - for asking people to send in their grot spots. What is Sarah going to do with these reports? Use them as a stick to beat the Labour council?\n  \u0026lsquo;sort these grot spots out\u0026rsquo;\n  \u0026lsquo;but your refocusing our efforts for short term gains\u0026rsquo;\n  \u0026lsquo;sort out these grot spots!\u0026rsquo;\n  Efforts are being made by the Brough council to tidy-up the area. I heard the person responsible for waste management at Borough level talk about the improvements and the performance of the council in this area at a recent Mapesbury Residents Association meeting. I also met with various people from the Council Streetcare team you talked about their initiatives in removing graffiti, managing domestic and trade waste, increasing participation in recycling and street cleaning. All are working hard tackling these issues.\nIs this effective? Adding another person the the loop? Why direct \u0026ldquo;grot spots\u0026rdquo; to Sarah for her to collect (and perhaps hold until a meeting point, thus adding delay to any action) and pass on for the council to resolve? According to a recent advertising campaign, \u0026ldquo;Brent People Do It Online\u0026rdquo; - access local governement services that is - Why not work in partnership with the council to enable either an email or picture text message to report a \u0026ldquo;grot spot\u0026rdquo; direct?\nOr perhaps that e-government is too much for both the council and our MP.\nThis campaign has been going on for a while. On the 8th of September 2003, before Sarah had been elected, she challenged the candidates of the other parties to back a clean-up program for Brent. Sarah said, \u0026ldquo;Labour politicians should be ashamed of their neglect of our area. Local people deserve much better for their Council Tax money. We need urgent action to clean up Brent.\u0026rdquo;\nA few days later, Sarah made the environment a key part of her manifesto for election in her \u0026ldquo;Green Pledge\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile campaigning later that same month Sarah said,\n \u0026ldquo;Clean, safe streets and decent local services should not be too much for local residents to ask for. If elected, I will work hard with local people, community groups and the Council to build a better Brent for everyone.\u0026rdquo;\n In October, after being elected, Sarah was continuing the clean up campaign, saying\n \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately\u0026hellip;years of Labour neglect have left a catalogue of fly-tips, abandoned cars and broken pavements. A Liberal Democrat controlled council would make street-cleaning a much higher priority and take positive action to clean up Brent. Liberal Democrats in Parliament have called for Councils to have powers to remove abandoned cars more swiftly. I shall be joining my colleagues in calling for these powers to be granted in Parliament, to help make Brent a cleaner place to live.\u0026rdquo;\n In November Sarah was appalled by the state of Neasden Shopping Centre and kept street care on the regeneration agenda of the Council.\nIn February of this year Sarah gave us a report on her first 6 months in office, tell us she had been continuing her campaign to clean up Brent she has reported hundreds of cases of Labour Council neglect in our area. My questions would be to whom and to what effect?\nSo\u0026hellip;how about giving us some performance data Sarah for this campaign to clean-up Brent. 10 months since your campaign pledge - and what have you acheived? It would appear to me that given the need to continue the campaign that very little has been acheived in root-cause reduction and in incident response.\nAlthough, I am glad to see that she\u0026rsquo;s been tackling the most visual reminder of capitalist greed.

What an informed and articulate audience! If there was ever an argument for extending suffrage to the 16-18 year old age group then last night\u0026rsquo;s broadcast proves it.\nI would have blogged this live, but since the untimely demise of my iBook and the now elongated repair time from Apple I had to make notes old-school style with lead and tree fibre. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to capture Sarah\u0026rsquo;s point of view on the subjects raised and capture a few quotes. Here goes\u0026hellip;\nAudience question: Do you think it was the correct decision to allow Yusuf Al-Qaradawi into the country?\nSarah supports a \u0026lsquo;moderate course\u0026rsquo; of tolerance. At this point in time, Yusuf Al-Qaradawi has not broken any of the laws of this land and, as such, he will be tolerated in this country until such time as he breaks the laws of this land. She did not want to see the UK go down the same route as America who profile air passengers and pre-screen entry using a variety of data sources that passengers \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t review, let alone dispute\u0026rdquo;. More on EU/USA data sharing\u0026hellip;\nAudience question: Does the panel believe that the proposed restrictions on smacking will turn many good and loving parents into criminals?\nSarah is opposed to the smacking of children and feels that this area is somewhere that the state should \u0026lsquo;extend the same protections of adults to children\u0026rsquo;. For Sarah, legislation in this area should be all or nothing. Ban smacking, protect children. She said that not smacking was about setting the right example to our children as it \u0026lsquo;teaches them not to lash out\u0026rsquo; in situations of fustration andangere.\nFor me, a smacking ban is pointless as it is not possible to police. However, if the end goal is some sort of social engineering project for a peaceful andharmoniouss society, then I\u0026rsquo;m all for the goal, just not this method.\nAudience question: Both Blair and Howard are promising choice in education in the next election, but who is offering the most choice?\nEducation, Education, Education.\nGiven the age range of the audience, education was bound to be a hot topic for the show. On the question of \u0026lsquo;Choice\u0026rsquo; in education, I have to agree with Jimmy Carr; \u0026lsquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t need a policy on choice, just better schools\u0026rsquo;.\nIt was funny to hear David Lamy and Boris Johnson split hairs of the definition of the words \u0026lsquo;choice\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;selection\u0026rsquo; - two words that really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be attached to the delivery of public services. We, the people, don\u0026rsquo;t choose or select to have poor education or health services in our local area. And while the capitalist mantra of competition driving up standards works within a competitive free market, it is not the way to deliver public services.\nIn answering the question, Sarah observed that neither Labour nor Conservative offer \u0026lsquo;meaningful choices\u0026rsquo; as what people want are good local schools. Sarah recently called an ajournment debate in Westminster Hall on the subject of fairer funding for Brent schools.\nAudience question: Has the government ever considered that the university fees aren\u0026rsquo;t the problem, the 50% target is?\nWell, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what happened to Sarah on this one. I had expected her to come out firing on this one, after all she\u0026rsquo;s paying off a student loan herself! The issue of top-up fees is an area that Sarah has campaigned about recently and voted against in parliament.\nAudience question: As 16 year-olds are able to smoke, get married, have sex etc, is it right that the voting age is still 18?\nHaving described votes at 16 as a \u0026ldquo;Question of Fairness\u0026rdquo;, this was a subject Sarah was keen to discuss.

Both debates took place on Tuesday 22nd June in Westminster Hall, which is separate from the main chamber of the House of Commons. Speeches made in Westminster Hall are still recorded in Hansard but are in a different section, which might account for why you could not locate them in the online Hansard. Theyworkforyou.com does not yet have links to either Westminster Hall debates or House of Lords debates, and so Sarah\u0026rsquo;s speeches were unfortunately not recorded on their website. Coincidentally and as an aside, I was in touch with the site\u0026rsquo;s author last week and he has told me that he is trying to get the links established.\nI am attaching a link by which you can access the relevant section of the online Hansard for Sarah\u0026rsquo;s debates.

Here we can make things more informing, have greater detail and relevence. Online, you can hyperlink! So. In order to make have greater depth, I set myself a challenge: add hyperlinks to Sarah\u0026rsquo;s speech to give more information to the online reader. Here is the result.\n_I represent a constituency with a large Muslim population. In preparing for the debate I trawled through some statements made by the Home Secretary, the Minister and the Prime Minister. Their words were reassuring and I have no doubt about the genuineness of the Minister\u0026rsquo;s sentiments and of statements such as these:\n\u0026ldquo;Expression of religious freedom is a core British belief\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;Mosques play an important role in community cohesion and civil renewal\u0026rdquo;,\nand\n\u0026ldquo;Many faiths build one nation\u0026rdquo;.\nThe problem is that when I speak to Muslims in my constituency and organisations that campaign on behalf of Muslims they tell me that the actions do not match the words.\nI shall quote a statement made by the Muslim Council of Britain in 2003:\n\u0026ldquo;It is the view of the Muslim Council of Britain that very little progress has been made in tackling the horror of Islamophobia in the United Kingdom since it was brought into sharp focus by the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia in its report published in 1997.\u0026rdquo;\nThe statement continues:\n\u0026ldquo;we strongly feel that the government has done little to discharge its responsibilities under international law to protect its Muslim citizens and residents from discrimination, vilification, harassment, and deprivation.\u0026rdquo;\nOthers have spoken of progress that has been made, but clearly to the Muslim Council of Britain an enormous amount still needs to be done. Others have spoken eloquently today on social exclusion issues—particularly the hon. Members for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) and for Regent\u0026rsquo;s Park and Kensington, North. However, when I speak to Muslims, the No. 1 issue that they raise is antiterrorism legislation—particularly section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.\nSearches of individuals suspected of terrorist offences rose from just over 10,000 in 2001-02 to more than 32,000 in 2002-03, which is an increase of more than 200 per cent. The vast majority of those stopped were in London, but just 1 per cent. of those stopped and searched under section 44 were arrested, compared with a 13 per cent. arrest rate for stops under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, suggesting that section 44 is being used indiscriminately.\nThe Home Office is not doing any kind of ethnic monitoring of that, and given the impact on the Muslim community, that is of grave concern. The indiscriminate and unmonitored use of stop and search powers contradicts the recommendations of the Macpherson report that powers should be used only proportionately and on suspicion that an offence has been committed. I urge extreme caution in the use of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\n(Muslim Council of Britain Press Release on this issue)\nThe imprisonment without trial of terror suspects at Belmarsh under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act has also provoked widespread anger. The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) says that there are enormous differences between Belmarsh and Guantanamo bay, and there are, thank goodness, but people\u0026rsquo;s human rights are still being flouted. It is a basic human right that people should be given a fair trial and either released or, if they have committed an offence, imprisoned. Given the backdrop of the war on terror and the attack on Iraq, which many Muslims perceive, rightly or wrongly, as an attack on Islam, we must understand that they see terrorism legislation as a direct attack on them.\nThe Home Office needs to consider a variety of options for dealing with the problem, because the present solution is simply not an acceptable long-term way of dealing with terrorism. I am not going to comment on a specific case; that would be highly inappropriate. The Joint Committee on Human Rights is currently considering other options, which I hope will be widely debated and implemented when they are made public. However, the Liberal Democrats opposed the extension of the present powers because, as the Government said when they introduced them, they were intended to be a short-term measure. Clearly, they are no longer a short-term measure, but a long-term one.\nWhen Muslims are tried in a court of law, there is a widespread feeling that justice is not done in an even-handed way. Following the appalling riots in Bradford in 2001, the Institute of Race Relations found a huge discrepancy between the sentences handed out to the Manningham rioters and those handed out to rioters from a neighbouring estate. It was concerned that the sentences were designed not to reflect \u0026ldquo;the severity of each individual\u0026rsquo;s actions\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;to discipline an entire community\u0026rdquo;. Those words are frightening, and I have heard them used by others who have talked about the terrorism legislation.\nThere are similar concerns about racism in prisons, and the failure to act appears to have led to the murder of the British Muslim, Zahid Mubarak, in his cell. I accept that there has been enormous progress in prisons, but there is still considerable work to be done.\nThe hon. Member for Regent\u0026rsquo;s Park and Kensington, North discussed attacks on Muslims, and there is widespread concern about how the media report the arrests of Muslims under the Terrorism Act. The hon. Member for Hendon talked about Muslims' feeling that they must always distance themselves from extremists and about how their expectations differ from those of other members of the community. Many of those issues underline the need for an equality Bill. Discrimination on the grounds of religion is being outlawed in employment, but as others have mentioned, it has still not been outlawed in other areas of service provision. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches argued strongly for the Bill introduced in the other place, which was the subject of widespread cross-party agreement, but, unfortunately, the Government did not support it. They have agreed to merge the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission, and that is welcome, but what do they intend to do to bring together all the piecemeal discrimination legislation?\nOther hon. Members have discussed the deprivation figures, which are startling. Muslim children account for about a third of the children living in workless households—twice the number for white British children. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, who is not in her seat at the moment, talked about the problem of overcrowding, and I certainly empathise, given the situation in my constituency. Tragically, it is typical to find eight people living in a two-bedroomed flat; such cases are not among the worst. That is why so much more work needs to be done. Similarly, three quarters of Bangladeshi and Pakistani children live in households receiving less than the national average wage and 54 per cent. of them are in homes that are on income support. There are much lower rates of employment among Pakistani and Bangladeshi men, and the average earnings of Muslim men are 68 per cent. of those of non-Muslims. That is staggering.\nThe hon. Member for Regent\u0026rsquo;s Park and Kensington, North discussed the fact that fewer Muslims are represented in the new deal than might be expected. There is an argument for much more individualised programmes to deal with specific problems; that is much more likely to get people back into work.\nPoor health has also been mentioned, which is so often associated with poor housing. The two are dramatically interlinked. Where there are overcrowding, poor health and poverty, there is often also educational under-achievement. I am delighted to hear that there has been so much improvement in Tower Hamlets. However, the statistics are still very worrying. Particularly significant is the widening gap in performance between boys and girls of Pakistani origin. Just 34 per cent. of boys of Pakistani origin achieve five grades A to C at GCSE, whereas 48 per cent. of girls do so. Both those figures are way below the national average.\nA report published earlier this month drew attention to problems in education, and said that the state sector was failing Muslim children. The solution is controversial across the House—hon. Members of all parties support faith schools, while others adamantly oppose them. Regardless of one\u0026rsquo;s view, the issue has to be addressed. Many of the problems can be tackled by improving housing and health, but that is not the only solution. I should be interested to know what the Government intend to do specifically to target the under-achievement of Muslim children.\nI am pleased to hear that the Minister will be discussing student loans with the Federation of Student Islamic Societies in the UK and Ireland, but I wonder whether a simpler solution would be to abolish the dramatic increase in the burden of debt by voting against the Higher Education Bill on Wednesday. We have all mentioned discrimination and social exclusion, but I want to close on a more positive note. I do not want to leave hon. Members with the impression that Muslims are passive victims. Those of us who represent constituencies with large Muslim populations know that that is not true. We know of the contributions that individual Muslims and local mosques and community centres make. The many organisations that have been mentioned today represent the expression of the best of Islam in this country.\nThe Al-Khoei foundation in my constituency, with its academic, diplomatic and educational work, is the embodiment of Islamic values, tolerance and inclusiveness; the political campaigning of the Muslim Association of Britain, the Muslim Council of Britain and the Muslim Public Affairs Committee is the expression of Islam\u0026rsquo;s passionate fight for social justice and fairness; the supportive work of the An-Nisa society in Brent shows Islam\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on compassion and mercy; and organisations such as Alif-Aleph bring British Muslims and Jews together to demonstrate Islam\u0026rsquo;s meaning of peace. Perhaps the injustice in this country is not only that suffered by Muslims but the fact that society is unable to benefit from what individuals and communities have to offer.\n","href":"/2004/07/03/making-the-spoken-word-more-informing.../","title":"making the spoken word more informing..."},{"content":"Yesterday, the \u0026lsquo;Brent \u0026amp; Brent East Liberal Democrats team\u0026rsquo; automailer sent me a content update for their website.\n Today\u0026rsquo;s content in brief from the Brent \u0026amp; Brent East Liberal Democrats web site: Articles posted to the site today:\n Fighting Discrimination against Muslims by Sarah Teather in Hansard, speech by Sarah Teather MP in Houses of Parliament   http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/article.php?id=16   Teather Calls for Fairer Funding for Brent Schools by Sarah Teather MP in Hansard, speech by Sarah Teather in the House of Commons   http://www.brentlibdems.org.uk/article.php?id=15   While speeches made by Sarah in the House are important, does posting a copy of the Hansard transcript of her address (along with the same photo that accompanied her maiden speech but with a different strap line) actually qualify as news?\nA picture is worth a thousand words.
